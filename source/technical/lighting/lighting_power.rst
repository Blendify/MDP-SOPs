Lighting Power
**************

The Lighting Power SOP defines the standards and procedures for distributing, connecting, and managing
electrical power for lighting systems used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).
Proper power planning and execution are critical for safety, system stability, and preventing
equipment damage or show interruptions.

This SOP applies to all lighting-related power, from small Edison circuits to full three-phase
camlock distribution.


Purpose
=======

- Establish safe and consistent power practices for lighting systems.
- Prevent overloads, undervoltage, and electrical failures.
- Standardize connector usage and labeling.
- Ensure compliance with electrical safety standards.
- Support efficient load-in, operation, and strike.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Lighting fixtures (moving and static)
- Lighting consoles and control devices
- Power distribution systems (distro)
- Power cabling and connectors
- Temporary and venue-provided electrical sources


Power Connector Standards
=========================

Approved Connector Types
------------------------

Lighting power may use the following connectors:

- **Edison (5-15/20)** – Small fixtures, consoles, low-current devices
- **PowerCON** – Medium-current lighting fixtures
- **True1** – Modern moving lights and LED systems (preferred)
- **L21-30 / L14-30** – Multi-circuit distro inputs
- **Camlock** – High-current three-phase distribution

Only approved connectors and cables may be used.


General Power Rules
===================

- Verify voltage and phase before connecting any equipment.
- Never hot-plug connectors unless they are rated for live connection.
- Do not mix connector types without approved adapters.
- Keep power and data cables separated where possible.
- Use GFCI protection where required.
- Never bypass breakers or safety devices.


Load Planning
=============

Pre-Show Planning
-----------------

Before load-in:

1. Review fixture power requirements.
2. Calculate total amperage per circuit and per phase.
3. Balance loads evenly across phases.
4. Verify venue or generator capacity.
5. Confirm connector availability.

Do not assume venue power is adequate—verify.


Circuit Limits
--------------

Typical limits (unless otherwise specified):

- Edison 120V: **15A max**, plan for 12A continuous
- PowerCON: Follow manufacturer ratings
- True1: Follow manufacturer ratings
- L21-30: **30A per phase**
- Camlock: As rated by feeder and distro

Continuous loads should not exceed **80%** of circuit rating.


Distribution Systems
====================

Lighting Distro
---------------

- Only trained personnel may connect or disconnect distro.
- Verify phase rotation and neutral integrity.
- Label all outputs clearly.
- Keep distro accessible and dry.
- Do not stack cases on distro units.

Camlock Procedures
------------------

1. Verify power source is de-energized.
2. Connect in order:
   - Ground  
   - Neutral  
   - Phases (A, B, C)  
3. Disconnect in reverse order.
4. Inspect connectors for damage before use.
5. Never force camlock connections.

Neutral integrity is critical—double neutrals must be handled per distro design.


Cable Management
================

- Use appropriately rated cable for the load.
- Avoid tight bends, kinks, or pinch points.
- Protect cables from foot traffic using ramps or covers.
- Secure vertical runs.
- Coil and store cables properly after use.


Fixture Powering
================

- Fixtures must be physically secured before power is applied.
- Verify correct voltage selection on fixtures.
- Power up systems gradually where possible.
- Monitor for abnormal behavior (flicker, resets, overheating).

Do not power fixtures with damaged connectors or cables.


Monitoring & Operation
======================

During the show:

- Monitor distro indicators and breakers.
- Watch for signs of overload or undervoltage.
- Do not add fixtures to live circuits without approval.
- Communicate power changes to all affected departments.


Strike & Power Down
===================

- Power down fixtures before unplugging.
- De-energize distro before disconnecting feeder.
- Disconnect camlock in correct order.
- Inspect cables for damage during strike.
- Coil and pack power cables properly.


Common Power Issues
===================

- Tripped breakers
- Undervoltage from overloaded circuits
- Phase imbalance
- Loose connectors
- Damaged cables
- Neutral overheating

Address issues immediately—do not ignore warning signs.


Safety Considerations
=====================

- Only qualified personnel may handle high-current power.
- Use PPE when connecting or disconnecting power.
- Keep liquids away from power equipment.
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures when required.
- Do not work on live power unless absolutely necessary and approved.

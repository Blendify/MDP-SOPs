Lighting Focus
**************

The Lighting Focus SOP defines the procedures and standards for focusing, aligning, and finalizing
lighting fixtures on-site. A proper focus ensures that lighting systems look intentional, clean, and
professional, while minimizing light spill, glare, and wasted output.

This SOP applies to all focused fixtures, including moving lights, static fixtures, and LED systems,
and should be followed during rehearsals and pre-show checks.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure consistent and professional lighting focus across all shows.
- Translate design intent into precise fixture alignment.
- Reduce on-site adjustments during show operation.
- Minimize glare, spill, and unintended shadows.
- Maintain safe working practices while focusing fixtures.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies during:

- Load-in after fixtures are hung and powered
- Focus sessions
- Rehearsals and cueing
- Final pre-show checks


Who Performs Focus
==================

- Lead Lighting Designer or Programmer
- Lighting Technicians
- Crew Lead overseeing safety

Only trained personnel may adjust fixtures at height.


Pre-Focus Requirements
======================

Before focusing begins:

- All fixtures must be:
  - Hung and clamped correctly  
  - Safetied  
  - Addressed and patched  
  - Powered and responding correctly  
- Truss, pipe, or rigging must be fully secured.
- Lift or ladder access must be approved and safe.
- Power and data paths must be stable.
- House lights should be set to an appropriate level for visibility.

Never focus fixtures that are not fully secured.


Focus Workflow
==============

1. Initial Rough Focus
----------------------

1. Bring fixtures to open white or a known focus palette.
2. Set pan/tilt to approximate positions.
3. Roughly frame the coverage area.
4. Identify fixtures requiring fine adjustment.

This step establishes baseline coverage.


2. Fine Focus
-------------

Adjust each fixture for:

- Pan and tilt precision
- Beam size (zoom)
- Edge quality (focus)
- Framing shutters (if applicable)
- Orientation and rotation

For static fixtures:
- Adjust yoke, pan, tilt, and shutters manually.
- Lock all knobs after adjustment.

For moving lights:
- Use console controls for precision.
- Store updated focus positions or palettes.


3. Color & Texture Review
-------------------------

- Verify color mixing consistency.
- Check gobo alignment and focus.
- Confirm prism orientation if used.
- Look for color mismatch or mechanical issues.

Replace or remove fixtures with visible defects.


4. Spill & Glare Control
------------------------

- Minimize spill onto:
  - Audience areas  
  - Projection surfaces  
  - Cameras  
  - Performers’ eyes  
- Adjust shutters, barn doors, or beam angles as needed.
- Use top hats or flags if required.

Clean focus improves both aesthetics and comfort.


5. Focus Documentation
----------------------

- Update focus palettes or presets.
- Label cues or notes clearly.
- Document any fixtures that:
  - Required special attention  
  - Could not be focused properly  

This documentation supports show operation and future events.


Safety During Focus
===================

- Always use appropriate PPE.
- Never stand under lifted loads.
- Maintain clear communication between ground and lift.
- Keep the area below lifts clear.
- Never bypass lift safety features.

Safety takes priority over speed.


Final Focus Check
=================

Before doors:

- Run a full system check.
- Confirm all fixtures hit their intended targets.
- Verify pan/tilt limits are correct.
- Confirm focus matches design intent.
- Address last-minute notes from the LD or PM.

Do not skip final focus checks.


Strike Considerations
=====================

- Return fixtures to neutral or home position before powering down.
- Avoid changing focus during strike unless required for safety.
- Report fixtures that drift or lose focus during the show.

Focus issues may indicate mechanical problems requiring repair.


Common Focus Issues
===================

- Fixtures drifting out of position
- Soft or uneven beams
- Misaligned shutters
- Color mismatch
- Mechanical noise during movement

Document issues for post-show maintenance.

Lighting Prep
*************

The Lighting Prep SOP defines the standardized process for preparing all lighting equipment before it
leaves the warehouse. Proper prep ensures fixtures are functional, correctly configured, clean,
labeled, and packed in a way that supports efficient load-in, programming, and operation on-site.

Lighting Prep occurs **after Pull Sheet, Scanning, and Staging**, and **before Truck Loading**.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all lighting equipment is show-ready before leaving the warehouse.
- Verify fixtures function correctly and are configured per the advance.
- Standardize addressing, mode selection, and labeling.
- Reduce on-site troubleshooting and delays.
- Maintain consistent quality and reliability across all MP/RV shows.


Who Performs Lighting Prep
==========================

- Warehouse lighting prep staff  
- Lighting technicians  
- Lead Lighting Tech / Programmer (for complex systems)  

All personnel performing lighting prep must follow this SOP exactly.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Moving lights  
- Static fixtures  
- LED bars, battens, and pixel systems  
- Lighting consoles (basic verification)  
- Lighting data devices (nodes, splitters)  
- Lighting power cabling and accessories  


Required Tools
==============

- Power distribution appropriate for fixtures being tested
- DMX console or DMX tester
- Network switch and node (if using Art-Net or sACN)
- Ladders or fixture stands as required
- Cleaning supplies (lens wipes, compressed air, microfiber)
- Label printer or pre-printed labels
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)


Procedure
=========

1. Fixture Inspection
---------------------

Before applying power:

1. Inspect housing for cracks, dents, or loose components.
2. Verify yoke movement and locking knobs.
3. Check clamps:
   - Correct clamp type  
   - No cracks or deformation  
   - Bolt threads clean and functional  
4. Verify safety cable:
   - Correct rating  
   - No fraying  
   - Proper carabiner or quick link  
5. Inspect power and data connectors for damage.

Any damaged fixture must be removed from prep and routed to repair.


2. Power & Data Connection
--------------------------

1. Connect fixture to the correct power type:
   - Edison  
   - PowerCON  
   - True1  
2. Verify voltage compatibility.
3. Connect DMX or network data as required.
4. Ensure cables are strain-relieved and not under tension.


3. Mode Selection
-----------------

1. Power on the fixture.
2. Set the DMX mode according to the advance or show file.
3. Confirm:
   - Channel count  
   - Pixel mode (if applicable)  
   - Control profile matches console library  
4. Disable unused modes (e.g., wireless DMX if not used).

Mode mismatches are a primary cause of on-site failures—verify carefully.


4. Addressing
-------------

1. Set the starting DMX address.
2. Confirm:
   - No overlap with other fixtures  
   - Address matches documentation  
3. Use RDM only if approved and compatible.
4. Label the fixture with:
   - Universe number  
   - Starting address  

Addresses must be legible when the fixture is hung.


5. Functional Testing
---------------------

Each fixture must pass a full functionality test:

- Pan and tilt (full range)
- Color mixing / color wheel
- Zoom and focus
- Gobos / prisms (if applicable)
- Shutter and strobe
- Dimming curve

Test using:
- Console
- DMX tester
- Network control (for pixel systems)

Any abnormal behavior must be addressed before packing.


6. Cleaning
-----------

1. Clean lenses with appropriate wipes.
2. Remove dust from fans and vents using compressed air.
3. Wipe exterior surfaces.
4. Remove old tape or labels.
5. Ensure displays and buttons are readable.


7. Labeling
-----------

Each fixture must have:

- Asset tag (MP or RV)
- Address label
- Universe label
- Orientation label if required (US/DS)

Labels must be:
- Durable  
- Legible  
- Placed consistently  


8. Accessory Verification
-------------------------

Confirm each fixture includes:

- Clamp  
- Safety cable  
- Correct power jumper  
- Any required adapters  

Missing accessories must be replaced before packing.


9. Case Packing
---------------

1. Place fixtures into correct case slots.
2. Ensure fixtures are seated properly in foam.
3. Protect lenses as required.
4. Store clamps and safeties in designated compartments.
5. Close and latch the case.
6. Apply job label to the case.

Cases must never be forced closed.


10. Final Sign-Off
------------------

1. Verify fixture count matches the pull sheet.
2. Confirm all fixtures passed testing.
3. Notify PM or Lead Tech that lighting prep is complete.
4. Mark lighting prep complete in the job notes or system.


Quality Control
===============

- Every fixture must be powered on and tested.
- No unaddressed or unlabeled fixtures may leave the warehouse.
- Fixtures must be clean and free of tape residue.
- Accessories must be complete.
- Prep must match the advance exactly.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Fixture fails testing**  
- Remove from prep immediately.  
- Route to repair and replace with approved substitute.

**Advance incomplete or unclear**  
- Pause prep and contact PM for clarification.

**Last-minute changes**  
- Update addressing, labels, and documentation before packing.

**Large fixture quantities**  
- Assign multiple prep stations and verify consistency across stations.

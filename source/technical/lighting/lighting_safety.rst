Lighting Safety
***************

The Lighting Safety SOP defines mandatory safety standards and procedures for all lighting-related
work performed by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Lighting systems involve
electrical power, rigging, heavy equipment, elevated work, and time-sensitive environments, making
strict safety compliance essential at all times.

This SOP applies to all personnel handling, installing, operating, or striking lighting equipment.


Purpose
=======

- Protect crew, clients, and venue staff from injury.
- Prevent damage to equipment and property.
- Ensure compliance with company, OSHA, and venue safety standards.
- Establish clear expectations for safe lighting practices.
- Reduce accidents caused by rushed or improper procedures.


Who This SOP Applies To
=======================

- Lighting technicians  
- Lead lighting designers and programmers  
- Rigging personnel handling lighting loads  
- Warehouse prep staff  
- Freelancers working under MP/RV  
- Project managers and technical directors  

Anyone working with lighting equipment must follow this SOP.


Core Safety Principles
======================

- **Safety overrides schedule** – No task is worth injury.
- **Stop work authority** – Anyone may halt work if unsafe.
- **Use rated hardware only** – Never substitute or improvise.
- **Follow training limits** – Do not perform tasks you are not trained for.
- **Communicate clearly** – Assumptions cause accidents.


Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
===================================

Required PPE when handling lighting equipment:

- Closed-toe, hard-soled shoes (steel-toe recommended)
- Gloves when handling fixtures, truss, or cases
- Eye protection when cutting, drilling, or blowing out fixtures
- Hearing protection in high-noise environments
- High-visibility vest when working near vehicle traffic

Additional PPE may be required based on venue or task.


Rigging & Overhead Safety
=========================

- All fixtures must be secured with:
  - A rated clamp  
  - A rated safety cable  
- Safeties must be attached to:
  - A rated structural point  
  - Not the clamp or yoke bolt  
- Never stand under:
  - Lifted truss  
  - Moving chain motors  
  - Suspended fixtures  
- Verify load ratings for:
  - Truss  
  - Pipe  
  - Hardware  
- Only trained personnel may operate:
  - Lifts  
  - Chain motors  

Never hang a fixture without a safety cable.


Electrical Safety
=================

- Verify voltage and phase before connecting equipment.
- Never hot-plug connectors not rated for live connection.
- Inspect power cables for damage before use.
- Keep liquids away from power equipment.
- Use lockout/tagout procedures when required.
- Do not overload circuits.
- Only qualified personnel may handle:
  - Camlock  
  - High-current distro  

Electrical issues must be addressed immediately.


Working at Height
=================

- Use ladders and lifts appropriate for the task.
- Inspect ladders and lifts before use.
- Maintain three points of contact when climbing.
- Never overreach.
- Secure tools to prevent drops.
- Keep area below lifts clear.
- Do not climb truss or pipe unless approved and trained.

Falls are one of the highest-risk lighting activities—remain vigilant.


Handling Fixtures & Cases
=========================

- Use proper lifting techniques.
- Team-lift heavy fixtures.
- Keep hands clear of pinch points.
- Latch cases before moving.
- Do not stack cases unsafely.
- Use carts whenever possible.

Avoid rushing—most injuries occur during load-in and strike.


Powering & Focusing Safety
==========================

- Fixtures must be secured before power is applied.
- Avoid looking directly into active fixtures.
- Use reduced intensity during focus.
- Communicate clearly between ground and lift.
- Never adjust fixtures without confirming control.

Heat and brightness can cause injury—use caution.


Weather & Environmental Safety
===============================

For outdoor events:

- Monitor weather continuously.
- Protect fixtures from rain or moisture.
- Shut down systems if lightning is present.
- Secure cables and equipment against wind.
- Follow venue and company weather policies.

Weather-related decisions must prioritize safety.


Emergency Procedures
====================

In case of injury or accident:

1. Stop work immediately.
2. Ensure scene safety.
3. Call emergency services if needed.
4. Notify PM or Crew Lead.
5. Use first aid if trained.
6. Complete incident report.

Know the location of:
- First aid kits  
- Fire extinguishers  
- Emergency exits  


Unsafe Conditions
=================

Report immediately:

- Damaged clamps or safeties
- Frayed cables
- Unstable rigging
- Exposed conductors
- Malfunctioning lifts

Tag unsafe equipment **Do Not Use**.


Quality Control
===============

- Safety checks must be performed daily.
- Crew Leads must enforce safety standards.
- Violations must be corrected immediately.
- Safety concerns must be documented.

No exceptions to safety rules.

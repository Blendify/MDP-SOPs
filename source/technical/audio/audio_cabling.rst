Audio Cabling
*************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for selecting, handling, deploying, protecting, and
resetting **audio cabling** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Clean,
reliable cabling is foundational to audio quality, troubleshooting speed, and on-site safety.

Poor cable management is one of the most common causes of audio failures.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure clean, noise-free audio signal transmission.
- Prevent cable-related failures and damage.
- Standardize cable selection, routing, and labeling.
- Maintain professional and safe stage and FOH environments.
- Extend the service life of MP/RV audio cabling assets.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio technicians  
- Audio leads / A1s  
- Warehouse staff prepping audio cable  
- Project Managers overseeing audio layouts  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone deploying or handling audio cabling must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- XLR microphone and line cables
- TRS and TS audio cables
- AES and digital audio cables
- Speaker signal cables (NL4, NL8, etc.)
- Stage box and snake cabling
- Patch cables and jumpers

Power cabling is covered under Power SOPs.


Audio Cable Standards
=====================

- Use balanced cables for microphone and line-level signals.
- Use appropriate cable type for digital audio.
- Match connector types correctly.
- Never substitute adapters without approval.
- Avoid consumer-grade or damaged cables.

Correct cable choice prevents noise and failure.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect cables for:
  - Jacket damage  
  - Bent or loose connectors  
  - Intermittent signal  
- Test cables using cable testers when available.
- Verify:
  - Clear length and type labels  
  - Ownership tags (MP / RV)  
- Coil cables properly using approved methods.
- Pack by type and length.

Damaged or intermittent cables must be removed from service.


Cable Deployment
================

Routing
-------

- Route audio cables away from power when possible.
- Cross power at 90° if unavoidable.
- Avoid high-traffic areas.
- Use cable paths consistently across systems.
- Keep FOH and stage runs organized.

Clean routing improves reliability.


Strain Relief
-------------

- Provide strain relief at consoles, stage boxes, and mics.
- Avoid tension on connectors.
- Secure cables to stands or structures when appropriate.

Strain causes intermittent failures.


Labeling & Identification
=========================

- Label both ends of critical cables.
- Use channel numbers or signal names where appropriate.
- Maintain consistent labeling conventions.

Clear labeling speeds troubleshooting.


Stage Boxes & Snakes
====================

- Verify snake integrity before deployment.
- Label inputs and outputs clearly.
- Secure fanouts to prevent stress.
- Avoid sharp bends near breakouts.

Snakes are high-value signal paths.


Speaker Signal Cabling
======================

- Use correct gauge for speaker loads.
- Match connector types and pinouts.
- Verify polarity.
- Avoid running speaker cables parallel to audio signal lines.

Speaker cabling errors affect system performance.


Digital Audio Cabling
=====================

- Use approved cable types for AES, Dante, AVB, etc.
- Observe length limits.
- Avoid tight bends.
- Verify clocking and network configuration.

Digital audio is sensitive to cable quality.


On-Site Monitoring
==================

- Periodically check cable runs.
- Listen for:
  - Noise  
  - Crackling  
  - Dropouts  
- Address issues immediately.
- Replace suspect cables promptly.

Cable issues often worsen during shows.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Disconnect cables by connector bodies.
- Inspect cables during strike.
- Coil neatly and consistently.
- Separate damaged cables immediately.
- Return cables to proper storage.

Strike is the final inspection opportunity.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drag cables.
- Avoid kinks and tight coils.
- Store by type and length.
- Keep cables clean and dry.
- Maintain organized storage locations.

Good handling extends cable lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy and handle cables properly.
- Maintain clean routing.
- Report cable issues immediately.

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Approve cable layouts.
- Enforce cabling standards.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect, test, and reset cables.
- Maintain labeling and organization.
- Remove unsafe cables from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Support safe and organized cable layouts.


Quality Control
===============

- No damaged or intermittent cables in use.
- Proper cable types used.
- Routing is clean and safe.
- Issues documented post-show.

Audio cabling quality affects every signal.

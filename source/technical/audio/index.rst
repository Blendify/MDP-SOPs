Audio
*****

The Audio department is responsible for the design, preparation, deployment, operation, and teardown
of all sound reinforcement and audio signal systems used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event
Revolution (RV). Audio systems directly affect audience experience and performer confidence and must
be deployed with precision, consistency, and attention to detail.

This section documents department-wide standards for audio prep, signal flow, system operation, and
on-site best practices.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure consistent, high-quality audio performance across all events.
- Standardize audio system prep, configuration, and operation.
- Prevent failures caused by improper gain structure, wiring, or RF issues.
- Define clear expectations for audio technicians and leads.
- Support safe, efficient collaboration with other technical departments.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Audio technicians  
- Audio leads and A1s  
- Monitor engineers and A2s  
- Warehouse staff prepping audio equipment  
- Project Managers overseeing audio scope  
- Freelancers operating MP/RV audio systems  

Anyone handling microphones, consoles, speakers, or audio signal paths should follow the standards
in this chapter.


Scope of Audio Systems
======================

This section covers:

- PA systems (point source, line array, fills)
- Subwoofers and low-frequency systems
- Audio consoles (FOH and monitor)
- Stage boxes and digital snakes
- Amplifiers and DSP
- Wired and wireless microphones
- RF coordination and antenna systems
- Playback devices
- Intercom and communication audio
- Audio cabling and power interfacing

This section does **not** replace manufacturer documentation or venue-specific audio requirements.


Audio Safety Fundamentals
=========================

- Protect hearing—use appropriate SPL management.
- Secure all flown or stacked speakers.
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy cabinets.
- Maintain clear cable routing to prevent trip hazards.
- Never bypass electrical or grounding protections.

Safe audio practices protect crew and clients.


Audio Department Philosophy
===========================

MP/RV audio standards follow these principles:

- **Clarity** – Clean signal flow from source to speaker.
- **Consistency** – Repeatable system layouts and workflows.
- **Gain Structure** – Proper levels at every stage of the signal path.
- **Documentation** – Console files, RF coordination, and patching documented.
- **Preparedness** – Redundancy and backups where appropriate.
- **Professionalism** – Clean, organized setups and calm operation.

Good audio starts with good preparation.


Audio Prep Standards
====================

Warehouse Prep
--------------

- Inspect all audio equipment before packing.
- Verify:
  - Console operation  
  - Firmware versions  
  - Microphone functionality  
  - Speaker and amp condition  
  - Cable integrity  
- Pack equipment by system and function.
- Label cases clearly by role or system.

No audio gear leaves the warehouse untested.


System Planning
===============

- Review event requirements:
  - Audience size  
  - Program type (speech, music, broadcast)  
  - Venue acoustics  
- Determine:
  - Speaker coverage  
  - Console placement  
  - Monitor needs  
  - RF channel count  
- Coordinate power and rigging needs early.

Planning prevents last-minute compromises.


On-Site Audio Operations
========================

Load-In & Setup
---------------

- Verify speaker placement and orientation.
- Secure speakers properly.
- Run audio cabling cleanly and logically.
- Maintain separation between audio and power when possible.
- Label both ends of critical cables.

Clean setup improves troubleshooting.


Gain Structure & Signal Flow
----------------------------

- Establish proper gain at the source.
- Avoid clipping at any stage.
- Maintain headroom throughout the system.
- Use DSP appropriately and deliberately.

Good gain structure prevents noise and distortion.


RF Coordination
---------------

- Perform RF scans when using wireless systems.
- Coordinate frequencies to avoid interference.
- Place antennas correctly.
- Monitor RF performance during the event.

RF issues must be addressed proactively.


Monitoring & Troubleshooting
============================

- Continuously monitor system performance.
- Listen for:
  - Distortion  
  - Dropouts  
  - Feedback  
  - Noise  
- Address issues methodically.
- Document recurring problems.

Calm troubleshooting maintains confidence.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down systems properly.
- Disconnect and coil cables correctly.
- Inspect gear during strike.
- Note any damage or issues.
- Return equipment to show-ready condition.

Strike is part of the job lifecycle.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Technicians
-----------------

- Set up and operate audio systems safely.
- Follow signal flow and gain standards.
- Report issues promptly.

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Design and oversee audio systems.
- Manage console configuration and RF coordination.
- Communicate with PMs and other departments.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define audio scope and expectations.
- Coordinate logistics and scheduling.
- Support technical decisions.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset audio equipment.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove damaged gear from service.


Quality Control
===============

- All systems tested before use.
- Console files saved and archived.
- RF coordination documented.
- Issues logged and addressed post-show.

Audio quality reflects the company.

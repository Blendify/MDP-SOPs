Audio Playback
**************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, configuring, operating, and resetting
**audio playback systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Playback
systems often carry critical show content and must be reliable, clearly routed, and fully tested
before doors.

Playback failures are immediately noticeable and unacceptable.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable playback of all show-critical audio.
- Prevent failures caused by incorrect routing, level mismatches, or file issues.
- Standardize playback workflows across operators and events.
- Support redundancy and failover when required.
- Maintain consistent audio quality and timing.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio leads / A1s  
- Playback operators  
- Audio technicians  
- Warehouse staff prepping playback equipment  
- Project Managers overseeing playback-heavy shows  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone responsible for triggering or routing playback must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Computer-based playback systems
- Dedicated playback hardware
- Show computers and media servers
- Playback interfaces and DIs
- Backup playback systems
- Timecode-synced playback (where applicable)

Video playback routing is covered under Video SOPs.


Playback Safety Fundamentals
============================

- Protect playback devices from power loss.
- Avoid software updates immediately before shows.
- Disable system notifications and sleep modes.
- Secure playback devices physically.

Playback stability is more important than new features.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Verify playback devices boot correctly.
- Confirm:
  - Required software is installed  
  - Licenses are valid  
  - Audio interfaces function properly  
- Test playback outputs.
- Pack:
  - Power supplies  
  - Interfaces  
  - Backup media  
- Label playback cases clearly.

Playback systems must be show-ready.


Media Preparation
=================

- Verify audio files are correct:
  - Format  
  - Sample rate  
  - Channel count  
- Normalize or level-match files as required.
- Rename files clearly and consistently.
- Load media in correct show order.

Never assume client-provided files are ready.


System Configuration
====================

- Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and auto-updates unless required.
- Lock system settings where possible.
- Configure audio interface routing correctly.
- Verify clocking and sample rate.

System stability is critical.


Playback Routing
================

- Route playback to dedicated console channels.
- Avoid sharing channels with live inputs.
- Label channels clearly.
- Verify left/right or multichannel mapping.

Clear routing prevents operator error.


Redundancy & Backup
===================

- Provide backup playback for critical cues.
- Maintain secondary devices when required.
- Test failover procedures.
- Keep backups powered and ready.

Redundancy protects the show.


Testing & Rehearsal
===================

- Test every playback cue.
- Verify levels relative to live content.
- Confirm timing with show flow.
- Re-test after any system change.

Playback must be rehearsed.


Operation During Show
=====================

- Monitor playback device status.
- Avoid unnecessary software interaction.
- Confirm cue readiness before triggering.
- Communicate with stage management.

Playback operation must be deliberate.


Troubleshooting Playback Issues
===============================

When issues occur:

- Check routing and mute states.
- Verify device output.
- Confirm file integrity.
- Switch to backup if required.

Do not troubleshoot live content aggressively.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down devices properly.
- Save any updated show files.
- Inspect equipment during strike.
- Reset systems to default state.

Reset prepares systems for the next show.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport playback devices in protective cases.
- Keep media organized and labeled.
- Store backups separately when possible.

Playback gear requires careful handling.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Approve playback system design.
- Verify routing and redundancy.
- Coordinate with PMs and show callers.

Playback Operators
------------------

- Prepare and trigger playback.
- Monitor system status.
- Communicate issues immediately.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep and test playback systems.
- Maintain standardized configurations.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define playback requirements.
- Support rehearsal and redundancy needs.


Quality Control
===============

- Playback tested before doors.
- Redundancy in place when required.
- Levels and routing verified.
- Issues documented post-show.

Playback reliability protects show integrity.

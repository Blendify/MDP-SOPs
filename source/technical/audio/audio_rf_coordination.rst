RF Coordination
***************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for planning, configuring, operating, and monitoring
**wireless RF audio systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Proper RF
coordination is critical for preventing dropouts, interference, and show-stopping failures.

Wireless systems must be planned deliberately and monitored continuously.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable operation of all wireless audio systems.
- Prevent RF interference and signal dropouts.
- Standardize RF planning and coordination workflows.
- Protect limited RF spectrum resources.
- Support consistent performance across venues and event types.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio leads / A1s  
- RF technicians  
- Monitor engineers  
- Warehouse staff prepping wireless systems  
- Project Managers overseeing RF-heavy events  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone deploying or operating wireless audio systems must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Wireless handheld microphones
- Wireless bodypack systems
- IEM (in-ear monitor) systems
- Antenna distribution systems
- RF coordination software and tools

This SOP does **not** replace FCC regulations or venue-specific RF rules.


RF Safety & Compliance
======================

- Operate wireless systems only within legal frequency bands.
- Follow FCC regulations at all times.
- Respect venue, broadcast, and public safety RF usage.
- Do not transmit on unlicensed or prohibited frequencies.

Illegal RF operation is prohibited.


RF Planning & Pre-Production
============================

- Review event requirements:
  - Number of wireless channels  
  - Microphones vs IEMs  
  - Venue type and size  
- Identify potential RF challenges:
  - Broadcast TV presence  
  - Other productions  
  - House wireless systems  
- Select appropriate frequency bands.

Planning prevents failure.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Verify wireless inventory and channel counts.
- Check firmware versions on transmitters and receivers.
- Inspect antennas, cables, and distribution units.
- Label all RF equipment clearly by channel.
- Install fresh batteries or charge rechargeables.

RF issues often start in prep.


RF Scanning
===========

- Perform RF scans on-site before coordination.
- Scan with:
  - Receivers  
  - Dedicated RF scanners  
- Identify:
  - Active RF signals  
  - Noise floor  
  - Problematic frequencies  

Never rely on factory presets alone.


Frequency Coordination
======================

- Use coordination software when available.
- Assign frequencies to avoid:
  - Intermodulation  
  - Adjacent-channel interference  
- Separate mic and IEM frequency ranges when possible.
- Document final frequency assignments.

Coordination must be deliberate.


Antenna Systems
===============

- Place antennas with clear line-of-sight to performers.
- Avoid proximity to metal or LED walls.
- Use antenna distribution systems correctly.
- Verify correct cable lengths and types.
- Maintain appropriate antenna spacing.

Antenna placement affects performance more than power.


System Setup & Testing
======================

- Verify transmitter-receiver pairing.
- Test each channel individually.
- Walk-test performers and stage areas.
- Verify IEM coverage.
- Monitor RF meters during testing.

Testing must simulate real use.


Operational Monitoring
======================

- Continuously monitor RF levels during the event.
- Watch for:
  - Dropouts  
  - Interference spikes  
  - Battery levels  
- Respond immediately to issues.
- Avoid making unplanned frequency changes mid-show.

RF vigilance is required.


Battery Management
==================

- Use fresh or fully charged batteries.
- Track battery usage by show segment.
- Replace batteries proactively.
- Never reuse partially depleted batteries for critical roles.

Battery failures mimic RF problems.


Troubleshooting RF Issues
=========================

When issues occur:

- Verify battery and power first.
- Check antenna connections.
- Confirm frequency integrity.
- Isolate the affected channel.
- Swap components methodically.

Do not guess—diagnose.


Post-Show Wrap-Up
=================

- Power down transmitters first.
- Document RF issues or problem frequencies.
- Reset frequencies if required.
- Remove batteries as needed.
- Inspect RF equipment during strike.

RF notes improve future shows.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Oversee RF planning and coordination.
- Approve frequency assignments.
- Communicate with PMs and venue.

RF Technicians
--------------

- Perform scans and coordination.
- Monitor systems during operation.
- Respond to RF issues.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep and test RF equipment.
- Maintain labeling and organization.
- Remove faulty RF gear from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Identify RF-heavy requirements early.
- Coordinate with venues and broadcasters.


Quality Control
===============

- RF scans performed for every wireless deployment.
- Frequencies documented.
- Antenna systems optimized.
- Issues logged post-show.

Reliable RF is intentional, not accidental.

Speakers & PA Systems
*********************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the preparation, deployment, operation, and strike
of **loudspeaker systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Proper speaker
deployment is critical for coverage, intelligibility, and audience experience.

Speaker systems must be deployed safely, evenly, and in alignment with the event’s audio goals.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure consistent, high-quality sound coverage.
- Prevent speaker-related safety hazards.
- Standardize speaker placement, rigging, and operation.
- Protect speaker equipment from damage.
- Support predictable, repeatable system performance.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio technicians  
- Audio leads and A1s  
- Warehouse staff prepping PA systems  
- Rigging and power teams interfacing with speakers  
- Project Managers overseeing audio scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone handling or placing speakers must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Point source speakers
- Line array systems
- Front fills, out fills, and delays
- Subwoofers
- Powered and passive speakers
- Amplifiers and speaker processing (DSP)

Rigging hardware is covered under Rigging SOPs.


Speaker Safety Fundamentals
===========================

- Speakers must be properly secured.
- Never stack speakers without rated hardware.
- Do not exceed manufacturer tilt or load limits.
- Keep speaker stacks clear of audience access.
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy cabinets.

Speaker failures present serious risk.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect speaker cabinets for damage.
- Verify:
  - Drivers are functional  
  - Connectors are intact  
  - Hardware points are undamaged  
- Confirm correct:
  - Rigging frames  
  - Fly bars  
  - Pins and hardware  
- Test speakers briefly before packing.
- Pack speakers with appropriate protection.

Damaged speakers must not be deployed.


System Planning
===============

- Review venue dimensions and acoustics.
- Determine:
  - Coverage requirements  
  - Throw distances  
  - Speaker count and type  
- Plan placement for:
  - Mains  
  - Fills  
  - Delays  
  - Subs  
- Coordinate rigging and power needs early.

Coverage planning is critical.


Speaker Placement
=================

Ground-Stacked Systems
----------------------

- Use flat, stable surfaces.
- Stack according to manufacturer guidelines.
- Strap or secure stacks when required.
- Prevent tipping or movement.

Never free-stack speakers.


Flown Systems
-------------

- Use approved rigging hardware only.
- Verify pick points and load ratings.
- Coordinate lifts with rigging team.
- Inspect all connections before load is overhead.

Flown speakers require heightened care.


Subwoofer Deployment
====================

- Place subs to maximize low-frequency coupling.
- Avoid obstructing audience pathways.
- Secure subs to prevent movement.
- Consider cardioid or end-fire configurations when appropriate.

Low-frequency energy affects stability.


Power & Signal Integration
==========================

- Verify correct voltage for powered speakers.
- Avoid overloading circuits.
- Label signal paths clearly.
- Maintain clean separation from power when possible.

Power and signal issues often present as audio problems.


System Tuning & Testing
=======================

- Verify polarity and phase alignment.
- Set appropriate crossover points.
- Balance output levels.
- Walk the room to verify coverage.
- Adjust EQ carefully.

Tuning should serve the program, not ego.


Operational Monitoring
======================

- Monitor speaker performance throughout the event.
- Listen for:
  - Distortion  
  - Rattles  
  - Dropouts  
- Address issues promptly.
- Avoid pushing systems beyond limits.

Protect the system and the mix.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down systems before disconnecting.
- Lower flown systems safely.
- Inspect speakers during strike.
- Pack speakers with care.
- Report any damage immediately.

Strike is part of equipment care.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Use proper carts and dollies.
- Do not drag cabinets.
- Protect grills and finishes.
- Store speakers in designated areas.

Proper handling extends speaker life.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy speakers safely.
- Follow placement and tuning standards.
- Report issues immediately.

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Design and oversee PA systems.
- Approve placement and tuning.
- Coordinate with rigging and power teams.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define audio coverage needs.
- Support safe deployment decisions.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset speaker systems.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove damaged speakers from service.


Quality Control
===============

- All speakers inspected before use.
- Placement follows approved plans.
- Systems tuned and tested.
- Safety issues corrected immediately.

Speaker deployment defines audience experience.

Microphones
***********

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the selection, preparation, deployment, operation,
and reset of **microphones** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Microphones
are the primary source of most audio signals and must be handled with care to ensure clarity,
reliability, and longevity.

Improper microphone handling is a leading cause of audio issues.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure consistent microphone performance.
- Prevent damage and premature wear.
- Standardize mic selection and deployment practices.
- Reduce feedback, noise, and handling issues.
- Support reliable audio capture across all event types.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio technicians  
- Audio leads / A1s  
- Monitor engineers  
- Warehouse staff prepping microphones  
- Project Managers overseeing audio scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone handling microphones must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Wired microphones
- Wireless handheld microphones
- Wireless bodypack systems
- Headset and lavalier microphones
- Instrument microphones
- Microphone accessories (clips, windscreens, stands)

RF-specific procedures are covered in a separate SOP.


Microphone Safety & Handling
============================

- Never drop microphones.
- Do not swing or toss microphones.
- Keep microphones dry.
- Avoid pulling on cables or connectors.
- Use windscreens where appropriate.

Mic damage is often preventable.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect microphones for:
  - Capsule damage  
  - Connector integrity  
  - Loose components  
- Test each microphone for:
  - Signal  
  - Noise  
  - Handling issues  
- Verify correct:
  - Clips  
  - Windscreens  
  - Cables or bodypacks  
- Label microphones clearly.

No microphone leaves the warehouse untested.


Microphone Selection
====================

- Choose microphones based on:
  - Application (speech, vocals, instruments)  
  - Environment  
  - Feedback risk  
- Avoid over-specifying.
- Use consistent mic models where possible.

Correct mic choice simplifies mixing.


Wired Microphones
=================

- Use quality, balanced cables.
- Provide proper strain relief.
- Secure cables to stands when possible.
- Avoid tight cable bends at the connector.

Cable issues often present as mic issues.


Wireless Microphones
====================

- Verify frequency compatibility.
- Label transmitters and receivers clearly.
- Install fresh or fully charged batteries.
- Secure bodypacks properly on performers.
- Test RF performance before doors.

Wireless systems require extra diligence.


Placement & Technique
=====================

- Position microphones correctly for the source.
- Maintain consistent distance.
- Aim directional mics properly.
- Educate presenters or performers when needed.

Placement affects sound more than EQ.


Wind & Plosive Control
======================

- Use windscreens outdoors.
- Use pop filters for speech when required.
- Monitor low-frequency rumble.

Prevention beats correction.


Monitoring & Troubleshooting
============================

- Listen for:
  - Dropouts  
  - Crackling  
  - Feedback  
  - Noise  
- Swap components methodically.
- Verify power and connections.

Troubleshoot calmly and logically.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down wireless systems.
- Remove batteries from bodypacks when required.
- Disconnect cables properly.
- Inspect microphones during strike.
- Clean microphones as needed.

Reset prepares mics for the next show.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Store microphones in padded cases.
- Keep capsules protected.
- Store wireless components together.
- Keep accessories organized.

Proper storage extends mic life.

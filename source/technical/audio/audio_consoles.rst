Audio Consoles
**************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the preparation, configuration, operation, and
reset of **audio consoles** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Audio
consoles are the control center of the audio system and must be handled with consistency, care, and
clear documentation.

Console configuration errors can affect the entire show.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure consistent and reliable console operation.
- Standardize console prep, show-file handling, and patching.
- Prevent errors caused by incorrect routing or gain structure.
- Protect console hardware and show data.
- Support predictable workflows across operators and events.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio leads / A1s  
- Monitor engineers  
- Audio technicians assisting with consoles  
- Warehouse staff prepping consoles  
- Project Managers overseeing audio scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone operating or configuring an audio console must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- FOH audio consoles
- Monitor consoles
- Digital and analog consoles
- Control surfaces and engines
- Console accessories (racks, touchscreens, UPS units)

Manufacturer-specific workflows are documented separately where required.


Console Safety Fundamentals
===========================

- Protect consoles from moisture and impact.
- Use proper lifting techniques.
- Secure consoles on stable surfaces.
- Provide clean, stable power.
- Avoid hot-plugging sensitive connections when possible.

Console damage is costly and disruptive.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect console hardware for damage.
- Verify:
  - Power supplies  
  - Screens and encoders  
  - Network ports  
  - Fader operation  
- Confirm correct firmware version.
- Test console boot and basic operation.
- Pack consoles with:
  - Correct power cables  
  - Network cables  
  - Accessories  
- Label cases clearly.

Consoles must leave the warehouse fully functional.


Show File Management
====================

File Standards
--------------

- Use consistent naming:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD_Client_Event_Console`
- Never overwrite master templates.
- Maintain separate FOH and monitor files when applicable.
- Include notes within the file when supported.

Clear naming prevents mistakes.


File Storage
------------

- Store show files in:
  - Console internal storage  
  - USB or approved external media  
  - Job folder in Google Workspace  
- Maintain backups whenever possible.

No show should rely on a single copy.


Console Setup
=============

Placement
---------

- Place consoles in protected, accessible locations.
- Maintain clear sightlines to stage when required.
- Avoid blocking walkways.
- Coordinate FOH placement with PM and venue.

Placement affects operation quality.


Power & Networking
------------------

- Use conditioned or UPS-backed power when available.
- Avoid shared circuits with high-draw devices.
- Verify network topology for digital stage boxes.
- Label network connections clearly.

Power and network stability are critical.


Patching & Routing
==================

- Verify input and output patching matches system design.
- Label channels clearly.
- Confirm stage box assignments.
- Test all inputs and outputs before the show.

Unverified patching causes delays.


Gain Structure & Configuration
===============================

- Set proper input gain at the source.
- Maintain headroom throughout the signal path.
- Avoid excessive digital gain.
- Configure dynamics and EQ deliberately.

Good gain structure prevents noise and distortion.


Monitor & Aux Systems
=====================

- Verify aux routing and mixes.
- Confirm monitor assignments with performers.
- Avoid accidental changes during the show.
- Lock channels or scenes where supported.

Monitor stability builds performer trust.


Operation During Show
=====================

- Save changes periodically.
- Avoid unnecessary configuration changes.
- Monitor system health and meters.
- Communicate with stage and production teams.

Calm operation maintains show quality.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Save final show files.
- Power down consoles properly.
- Disconnect cables carefully.
- Inspect consoles during strike.
- Reset consoles to default or template state.

Reset ensures readiness for the next job.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport consoles in proper cases.
- Protect screens and controls.
- Keep consoles clean and dry.
- Store in designated areas.

Proper handling extends console lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Leads / A1

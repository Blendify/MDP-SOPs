Audio Troubleshooting
*********************

This SOP defines the standardized approach for diagnosing and resolving **audio system issues**
during prep, setup, rehearsal, and live operation. Effective troubleshooting requires calm,
methodical thinking, clear communication, and adherence to signal flow fundamentals.

Random adjustments create more problems than they solve.


Purpose
=======

- Resolve audio issues quickly and safely.
- Minimize show disruption.
- Prevent repeated or cascading failures.
- Standardize troubleshooting methodology across operators.
- Support clear post-show reporting and improvement.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Audio leads / A1s  
- Monitor engineers  
- Audio technicians  
- Warehouse staff assisting with prep diagnostics  
- Project Managers supporting live troubleshooting  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone responding to audio issues must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to all audio system components, including:

- Microphones (wired and wireless)
- Consoles and routing
- Stage boxes and snakes
- RF systems
- Playback devices
- DSP, amplifiers, and speakers
- Audio cabling and power interfaces


Troubleshooting Principles
==========================

Always follow these rules:

- Stay calm.
- Change **one thing at a time**.
- Follow the signal path logically.
- Verify before adjusting.
- Communicate clearly with the team.

Panic creates mistakes.


Initial Assessment
==================

When an issue is reported:

- Identify:
  - What is affected?  
  - When did it start?  
  - Is it constant or intermittent?  
- Determine scope:
  - Single channel  
  - Group of channels  
  - Entire system  

Scope defines strategy.


Follow the Signal Flow
======================

Start at the source and move downstream:

1. Source (mic, playback device)
2. Cable
3. Stage box / snake
4. Console input
5. Channel processing
6. Bus / matrix
7. DSP / amplifier
8. Speaker

Verify each stage before moving on.


Common Issues & Checks
======================

No Signal
---------

- Is the source producing signal?
- Is the cable functional?
- Is the channel muted?
- Is the correct input patched?
- Is phantom power required?

Feedback
--------

- Identify the source.
- Lower gain before EQ.
- Verify mic placement.
- Check monitor sends.
- Adjust system EQ cautiously.

Distortion
----------

- Check input gain and headroom.
- Look for clipping in the signal path.
- Verify output levels.
- Check speaker limits.

Noise / Hum
-----------

- Check grounding.
- Verify balanced connections.
- Isolate offending devices.
- Check power sources.

RF Dropouts
-----------

- Check battery levels.
- Verify antenna placement.
- Monitor RF meters.
- Confirm frequency coordination.


Wireless Troubleshooting
========================

- Swap batteries first.
- Check transmitter mute state.
- Verify receiver frequency.
- Inspect antennas and cables.
- Swap components methodically.

Wireless issues often have simple causes.


Playback Issues
===============

- Confirm device output routing.
- Verify file playback.
- Check interface connections.
- Switch to backup system if needed.

Never troubleshoot playback aggressively mid-show.


Escalation & Communication
==========================

- Inform the Audio Lead immediately.
- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Escalate to PM if:
  - Safety is affected  
  - Show flow is impacted  
- Avoid side conversations during critical moments.

Clear communication speeds resolution.


Post-Issue Documentation
========================

After resolving the issue:

- Document:
  - What happened  
  - Root cause  
  - Resolution  
- Note any equipment needing service.
- Share findings with warehouse and leadership.

Documentation prevents repeat issues.


When to Stop & Reset
====================

- If multiple systems are affected:
  - Stop and reassess  
  - Reset to last known-good state  
- Do not chase symptoms endlessly.

Sometimes the fastest fix is a reset.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Audio Leads / A1
----------------

- Direct troubleshooting efforts.
- Make final technical decisions.
- Communicate with PM and production.

Audio Technicians
-----------------

- Execute troubleshooting steps.
- Report findings accurately.
- Avoid unauthorized changes.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Support prep diagnostics.
- Service or flag problematic gear.

Project Managers
----------------

- Support troubleshooting decisions.
- Manage client expectations if needed.


Quality Control
===============

- Issues addressed methodically.
- Root causes identified.
- Equipment issues logged.
- SOPs updated if patterns emerge.

Good troubleshooting improves future shows.

Rigging
*******

The Rigging department is responsible for the safe design, preparation, installation, operation, and
removal of all overhead and structural elements used in MP/RV productions. Rigging is inherently
high-risk work and must be executed with strict adherence to safety standards, load calculations,
and approved procedures.

This section documents the rigging-specific standards that apply across warehouse prep, transport,
on-site execution, and strike.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all rigging work is performed safely and consistently.
- Prevent injuries, equipment damage, and structural failures.
- Establish clear standards for rigging prep, inspection, and operation.
- Define responsibilities for rigging personnel and leadership.
- Provide a reference for both routine and complex rigging scenarios.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Rigging technicians  
- Lead riggers  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing rigging scope  
- Warehouse staff prepping rigging equipment  
- Freelancers performing rigging work  

Only trained and authorized personnel may perform rigging tasks.


Scope of Rigging
================

This section covers:

- Chain motors (electric and manual)
- Truss systems (box, triangle, pipe)
- Spansets, roundslings, and steel
- Shackles and hardware
- Pick points and load distribution
- Ground-supported structures
- Safety and inspection procedures

This section does **not** replace venue-specific rigging rules, engineering requirements, or local
regulations.


Rigging Safety Fundamentals
===========================

- All rigging must be designed within rated limits.
- Load calculations must be completed before installation.
- Never exceed working load limits (WLL).
- Never stand or work under a suspended load.
- All rigging hardware must be rated and inspected.
- Stop work authority applies to all rigging operations.

Unsafe rigging is unacceptable under any circumstance.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained riggers may perform rigging tasks.
- Specialized tasks (motors, arena rigging, structural builds) require additional training.
- Freelancers must demonstrate competency before assignment.
- PMs must verify crew qualifications for the rigging scope.

Unqualified personnel must not rig.


Rigging Prep Standards
======================

Warehouse Prep
--------------

- Inspect all rigging equipment before packing.
- Verify:
  - Load ratings  
  - Certifications  
  - Condition  
- Remove damaged or questionable items from service.
- Pack rigging by type and size.
- Label cases clearly.

No rigging gear leaves without inspection.


Documentation & Planning
------------------------

- Review rigging plots and weight calculations.
- Confirm venue requirements and limitations.
- Coordinate with other departments on loads and placement.
- Identify required hardware and redundancies.

Planning prevents failures.


On-Site Rigging Operations
==========================

Load-In
-------

- Verify venue approvals and access.
- Identify structural attachment points.
- Install rigging hardware methodically.
- Double-check all connections.
- Attach safeties where required.

Communication is critical during rigging.


Working at Height
-----------------

- Use approved access equipment.
- Maintain three points of contact.
- Secure tools to prevent drops.
- Keep work areas below clear.
- Never rush elevated work.

Dropped objects are a serious hazard.


Motor & Lift Operations
=======================

- Inspect motors and controls before use.
- Verify correct power and control connections.
- Establish clear hand signals or communication.
- Lift loads slowly and evenly.
- Stop immediately if abnormal behavior occurs.

Motor operation requires full attention.


Inspection & Redundancy
=======================

- Inspect all rigging before applying load.
- Use secondary safeties where required.
- Verify shackle orientation and pin security.
- Confirm spanset placement and protection.

Redundancy saves lives.


Strike & De-Rigging
===================

- De-energize motors and power systems.
- Lower loads in a controlled manner.
- Remove hardware carefully.
- Inspect gear during removal.
- Separate damaged items immediately.

Strike is as critical as install.


Rigging Equipment Handling
==========================

- Do not drag or throw rigging gear.
- Protect gear from abrasion and chemicals.
- Keep slings clean and dry.
- Store hardware in designated cases.

Mishandling shortens lifespan and reduces safety.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Rigging Technicians
-------------------

- Perform rigging tasks safely.
- Inspect equipment before use.
- Follow approved plans and procedures.

Lead Riggers
------------

- Oversee rigging operations.
- Verify calculations and installations.
- Coordinate with PMs and other departments.
- Enforce safety standards.

Project Managers
----------------

- Ensure rigging scope is defined.
- Verify crew qualifications.
- Coordinate venue approvals.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect and prep rigging equipment.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove unsafe gear from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No uninspected rigging gear in use.
- All loads verified before lift.
- Safety violations corrected immediately.
- Documentation completed as required.

Rigging quality directly affects safety.

Truss Systems
*************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the preparation, assembly, installation, use, and
strike of **truss systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Truss is a
primary structural element in many productions and must be handled with precision, planning, and
strict safety compliance.

Improper truss handling or assembly can result in catastrophic failure.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all truss systems are assembled and used safely.
- Prevent structural failures caused by incorrect assembly or loading.
- Standardize truss prep, inspection, and installation workflows.
- Define clear responsibilities for truss-related work.
- Support safe collaboration between rigging, lighting, video, and power teams.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Rigging technicians  
- Lead riggers  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing truss-based systems  
- Warehouse staff prepping truss  
- Freelancers authorized to work with truss  

Only trained personnel may assemble or install truss systems.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Box truss
- Triangle truss
- Pipe truss
- Truss corners, circles, and specialty sections
- Truss connection hardware (bolts, spigots, pins)
- Ground-supported and flown truss systems

This SOP does **not** replace engineered drawings or venue-specific structural requirements.


Truss Safety Fundamentals
=========================

- Never exceed manufacturer load ratings.
- All truss systems must be properly supported.
- Load calculations must include:
  - Truss self-weight  
  - Fixtures and equipment  
  - Cable weight  
  - Dynamic loads  
- Use only compatible truss and hardware.
- Stop work authority applies at all times.

Truss failures can be fatal.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained personnel may assemble truss.
- Complex structures require lead rigger oversight.
- Freelancers must demonstrate familiarity with the truss type in use.
- PMs must ensure qualified crew for the truss scope.

Unqualified assembly is prohibited.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect truss sections for:
  - Cracks  
  - Bent chords  
  - Damaged welds  
- Inspect connection hardware:
  - Correct type  
  - No deformation  
  - Proper fit  
- Verify truss compatibility.
- Pack truss by type and length.
- Include correct hardware for each system.

Damaged truss must be removed from service.


Planning & Load Calculations
============================

- Review truss layout and drawings.
- Calculate loads per span and pick point.
- Confirm support method:
  - Motors  
  - Towers  
  - Bases  
- Coordinate fixture placement with lighting and video teams.
- Verify venue capacity.

Never assume load capacity.


On-Site Assembly
================

Ground Assembly
---------------

- Assemble truss on flat, stable ground.
- Align chords and diagonals properly.
- Insert all connection hardware fully.
- Secure all pins, bolts, or spigots.
- Double-check every connection.

Incomplete connections are unacceptable.


Flown Truss
-----------

- Verify motor spacing and capacity.
- Attach motors using approved hardware.
- Lift truss slowly and evenly.
- Monitor for twisting or binding.
- Stop immediately if abnormal behavior occurs.

Flown systems require constant vigilance.


Ground-Supported Truss
======================

- Use rated bases and towers.
- Verify base footprint and ballast requirements.
- Level structures before loading.
- Secure towers as required.

Ground support must be engineered appropriately.


Load Attachment
===============

- Attach equipment using approved hardware.
- Distribute loads evenly.
- Avoid point-loading when possible.
- Secure all fixtures with secondary safeties.

Load placement affects structural integrity.


Inspection & Redundancy
=======================

- Inspect truss after assembly and before loading.
- Verify all connections are secure.
- Confirm safeties and redundancies.
- Re-inspect after major changes.

Inspection is continuous, not one-time.


Strike & De-Rigging
===================

- Remove loads before disassembly.
- Lower flown truss fully before disconnecting.
- Remove hardware carefully.
- Inspect truss during strike.
- Separate damaged components immediately.

Strike must be controlled and methodical.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drop or drag truss.
- Protect truss from impact.
- Store truss on proper racks.
- Keep truss clean and dry.
- Keep hardware organized and labeled.

Proper handling extends truss lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Rigging Technicians
-------------------

- Assemble and install truss safely.
- Follow approved plans.
- Report issues immediately.

Lead Riggers
------------

- Oversee truss operations.
- Verify calculations and assembly.
- Enforce safety standards.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define truss scope.
- Verify crew qualifications.
- Coordinate venue approvals.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect and prep truss.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove unsafe truss from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No damaged truss in use.
- All connections verified.
- Loads within limits.
- Safety issues corrected immediately.

Truss safety is non-negotiable.

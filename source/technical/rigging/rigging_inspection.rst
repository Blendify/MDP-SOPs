Rigging Inspection
******************

This SOP defines the inspection requirements, criteria, and documentation standards for all rigging
equipment used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Rigging inspections are a
critical safety control and must be performed consistently at multiple stages of the equipment
lifecycle.

No rigging equipment may be used unless it has passed inspection.


Purpose
=======

- Prevent rigging-related failures and accidents.
- Identify damaged, worn, or unsafe equipment before use.
- Standardize inspection procedures across all rigging gear.
- Ensure compliance with safety standards and best practices.
- Establish clear documentation and accountability for rigging condition.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Rigging technicians  
- Lead riggers  
- Warehouse staff performing prep inspections  
- Repair and maintenance staff  
- Project Managers overseeing rigging scope  
- Authorized freelancers handling rigging equipment  

Anyone handling or approving rigging equipment must understand inspection requirements.


Inspection Frequency
====================

Rigging equipment must be inspected at the following times:

- **Warehouse Prep Inspection** – before deployment  
- **Pre-Use Inspection** – before installation on-site  
- **Operational Inspection** – during use  
- **Strike Inspection** – during removal  
- **Periodic Inspection** – scheduled, documented inspections  

Failure to inspect at any stage is a violation of this SOP.


General Inspection Rules
========================

- Inspections must be visual and tactile.
- Adequate lighting is required.
- Clean equipment before inspection when possible.
- If unsure about condition, remove from service.
- Never assume prior inspections are sufficient.

When in doubt, take it out.


Equipment Covered
=================

This SOP applies to all rigging-related equipment, including:

- Chain motors
- Motor controllers and pendants
- Truss sections and hardware
- Shackles, spansets, and steel
- Slings and roundslings
- Eyebolts and attachment points
- Ground support components
- Rigging tools and accessories


Inspection Criteria by Equipment Type
=====================================

Chain Motors
------------

Inspect for:

- Chain wear or elongation
- Hook deformation or cracks
- Safety latch operation
- Oil leaks or unusual noise
- Damaged power or control cables
- Valid inspection or service tag

Remove motors from service if any issue is observed.


Truss
-----

Inspect for:

- Cracked or bent chords
- Damaged welds
- Deformation at connection points
- Compatibility issues
- Missing or damaged hardware

Truss with structural damage must be retired or repaired by qualified professionals.


Shackles & Hardware
-------------------

Inspect for:

- Cracks or deformation
- Stripped or damaged threads
- Bent pins or bodies
- Missing markings or ratings
- Excessive corrosion

Unrated or damaged hardware is prohibited.


Spansets & Slings
-----------------

Inspect for:

- Cuts, tears, or abrasion
- Core fiber exposure
- Chemical or heat damage
- Faded, missing, or illegible tags
- Uneven wear patterns

Any compromised sling must be removed from service.


Steel & Wire Rope
-----------------

Inspect for:

- Broken wires
- Kinks or birdcaging
- Crushing or corrosion
- Damaged terminations

Steel damage may be subtle—inspect carefully.


Ground Support Components
-------------------------

Inspect for:

- Bent or cracked frames
- Missing hardware
- Leveling mechanisms
- Structural integrity
- Compatibility with loads

Ground support failures can be catastrophic.


Inspection Outcomes
===================

Pass
----

- Equipment is safe and within acceptable limits.
- May be used as intended.

Remove from Service
-------------------

- Equipment shows damage, wear, or uncertainty.
- Tag **Do Not Use**.
- Route to repair or retirement.

Never return unsafe equipment to circulation.


Tagging & Identification
========================

- Use clear **Do Not Use** tags for failed items.
- Do not rely on verbal warnings.
- Segregate failed equipment immediately.
- Do not remove tags without authorization.

Tags protect everyone.


Documentation
=============

Inspections must be documented when required:

- Scheduled periodic inspections
- Motor service inspections
- High-risk or critical equipment
- Equipment removed from service

Documentation should include:
- Asset or serial number
- Date
- Inspector name
- Findings
- Action taken

Records must be retained per policy.


Responsibilities
================

Rigging Technicians
-------------------

- Inspect equipment before use.
- Stop work if issues are found.
- Report concerns immediately.

Lead Riggers
------------

- Verify inspections are performed.
- Review inspection findings.
- Enforce removal of unsafe equipment.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Perform prep inspections.
- Track failed equipment.
- Maintain inspection records.

Project Managers
----------------

- Ensure inspection requirements are met.
- Support equipment removal decisions.


Quality Control
===============

- No uninspected rigging equipment in use.
- Failed items removed immediately.
- Documentation completed when required.
- Repeated failures reviewed for root cause.

Inspection discipline saves lives.

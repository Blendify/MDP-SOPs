Ground Support Systems
**********************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the design, preparation, installation, operation,
and strike of **ground-supported rigging systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event
Revolution (RV). Ground support systems carry significant loads and require careful planning,
ballasting, and inspection to ensure stability and safety.

Improper ground support can result in collapse, injury, or severe equipment damage.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure ground-supported structures are designed and built safely.
- Prevent tipping, sinking, or structural failure.
- Standardize prep, installation, and inspection procedures.
- Define responsibilities for ground support operations.
- Support coordination between rigging, lighting, video, and power teams.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Rigging technicians  
- Lead riggers  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing ground-supported systems  
- Warehouse staff prepping ground support equipment  
- Authorized freelancers  

Only trained and authorized personnel may install or modify ground-supported structures.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to all **ground-supported rigging systems**, including:

- Truss towers and goal posts
- Totems and vertical truss structures
- Crank stands and tower lifts
- Baseplates and tower bases
- Ballast systems (steel plates, concrete blocks, water ballast)
- Temporary outdoor and indoor support structures

This SOP does **not** replace engineered drawings, stamped calculations, or venue-specific
requirements.


Ground Support Safety Fundamentals
==================================

- All ground-supported systems must remain stable under all expected conditions.
- Loads must be calculated before installation.
- Ballast requirements must be confirmed and met.
- Structures must be level and plumb.
- Environmental factors (wind, weather, ground condition) must be considered.
- Stop work authority applies at all times.

If stability is uncertain, work must stop.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained personnel may assemble ground-supported systems.
- Outdoor or high-load structures require lead rigger oversight.
- Freelancers must demonstrate familiarity with the system in use.
- PMs must ensure qualified crew for the ground support scope.

Unqualified installation is prohibited.


Planning & Design
=================

- Review layout, dimensions, and load paths.
- Calculate total loads including:
  - Truss  
  - Fixtures and equipment  
  - Cable weight  
  - Dynamic and wind loads  
- Confirm ballast type, quantity, and placement.
- Verify ground conditions:
  - Asphalt  
  - Concrete  
  - Grass  
  - Soil  

Assumptions about ground conditions are not acceptable.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect all ground support components:
  - Bases and frames  
  - Towers or stands  
  - Pins, bolts, and hardware  
- Verify compatibility between components.
- Confirm ballast inventory matches design requirements.
- Pack systems completely, including required hardware.

Incomplete systems must not be deployed.


On-Site Installation
====================

Base Placement
--------------

- Place bases on stable, level ground.
- Use base plates or pads to distribute load when required.
- Verify base orientation and spacing.
- Shim only with approved materials.

Uneven bases compromise stability.


Tower & Structure Assembly
--------------------------

- Assemble towers per manufacturer guidelines.
- Insert all pins and hardware fully.
- Verify locking mechanisms.
- Keep structures plumb during assembly.

Never force components to fit.


Ballasting
==========

- Install ballast exactly as specified.
- Distribute ballast evenly.
- Secure ballast to prevent movement.
- Do not substitute ballast without approval.

Insufficient ballast is a major hazard.


Load Attachment
===============

- Attach loads only after structure is complete and stable.
- Distribute loads evenly.
- Avoid eccentric or point loading.
- Secure all fixtures with secondary safeties.

Load placement affects stability.


Environmental Considerations
============================

- Monitor wind conditions, especially outdoors.
- Establish wind action thresholds.
- Remove or lower loads if conditions exceed limits.
- Protect bases from water pooling or erosion.

Weather can change quickly.


Inspection & Monitoring
=======================

- Inspect ground support before loading.
- Re-inspect after loading.
- Monitor throughout the event for:
  - Movement  
  - Settlement  
  - Loose hardware  
- Stop work if instability is observed.

Ground support requires continuous vigilance.


Strike & De-Installation
========================

- Remove loads before disassembly.
- Remove ballast only after loads are removed.
- Disassemble structures methodically.
- Inspect components during strike.
- Separate damaged items immediately.

Strike must be controlled and deliberate.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drop or drag components.
- Protect bases and towers from impact.
- Store components by type and system.
- Keep hardware organized and labeled.

Proper handling extends service life.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Rigging Technicians
-------------------

- Assemble and monitor ground support systems safely.
- Follow approved plans and procedures.
- Report issues immediately.

Lead Riggers
------------

- Verify calculations and ballast requirements.
- Oversee installation and operation.
- Enforce safety standards.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define ground support scope.
- Verify crew qualifications.
- Coordinate venue approvals and requirements.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect and prep ground support equipment.
- Ensure complete systems are packed.
- Remove unsafe components from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No ground support without load calculations.
- Ballast requirements met without exception.
- Structures remain stable throughout the event.
- Safety issues corrected immediately.

Ground support stability is critical to safety.

Rigging Hardware
****************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the selection, inspection, use, handling, and
storage of **general rigging hardware** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).
Rigging hardware is safety-critical and must always be rated, compatible, and in good condition.

Improper hardware selection or use can result in serious injury or catastrophic failure.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all rigging hardware is used safely and consistently.
- Prevent failures caused by worn, damaged, or unrated hardware.
- Standardize inspection and handling procedures.
- Establish clear accountability for rigging hardware condition.
- Support compliance with industry safety best practices.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Rigging technicians  
- Lead riggers  
- Technical Directors  
- Warehouse staff prepping rigging hardware  
- Project Managers overseeing rigging scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Only trained personnel may select or install rigging hardware.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to all **non-lighting-specific** rigging hardware, including:

- Shackles (screw pin, bolt type)
- Spansets and roundslings
- Wire rope and steel slings
- Eyebolts and rigging points
- Turnbuckles
- Quick links and carabiners (rated only)
- Beam clamps and structural attachment devices
- Load-rated hardware used in rigging systems

Lighting-specific clamps and safeties are covered under Lighting Rigging Hardware SOPs.


Rigging Hardware Standards
==========================

Approved & Rated Hardware Only
------------------------------

- All hardware must have a visible WLL or manufacturer rating.
- Hardware without markings must be removed from service.
- Field-modified hardware is prohibited.
- Mixing incompatible hardware types is not allowed.

If the rating is unknown, the hardware is unsafe.


Inspection Requirements
=======================

Hardware must be inspected:

- During warehouse prep
- Before installation
- During strike
- Any time damage is suspected

Inspection Checklist
--------------------

Remove hardware from service if any of the following are observed:

- Cracks, bends, or deformation
- Elongated holes
- Stripped or damaged threads
- Excessive wear or corrosion
- Missing pins or safety features
- Illegible or missing rating marks


Shackles
========

- Use correct shackle type and size for the load.
- Pin must be fully seated.
- Orient pin correctly relative to load.
- Do not side-load unless rated for it.
- Safety-wire pins when required.

Never substitute bolts for shackle pins.


Spansets & Slings
=================

- Verify correct length and capacity.
- Protect slings from sharp edges.
- Use corner protection when required.
- Never knot slings.
- Avoid twisting.

Inspection
----------

Remove from service if:

- Cuts or abrasion exceed limits
- Core fibers are visible
- Chemical or heat damage is present
- Tags are missing or illegible


Steel & Wire Rope
=================

- Inspect for broken wires.
- Check for kinks, birdcaging, or crushing.
- Verify proper terminations.
- Do not exceed rated capacity.

Steel damage can be difficult to see—inspect carefully.


Eyebolts & Attachment Points
============================

- Use only rated eyebolts.
- Verify proper seating and orientation.
- Follow manufacturer angle reduction ratings.
- Do not use shoulderless eyebolts for angular loads.

Improper eyebolts are a common failure point.


Quick Links & Carabiners
========================

- Use only load-rated hardware.
- Verify gates close fully.
- Locking mechanisms must function properly.
- Do not use consumer or climbing hardware unless rated for rigging.

Unrated hardware is prohibited.


Installation Best Practices
===========================

- Match hardware capacity to calculated loads.
- Avoid cross-loading.
- Minimize angular forces where possible.
- Use redundant connections when required.
- Verify all connections before loading.

Hardware selection matters as much as installation.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not throw or drop hardware.
- Store by type and size.
- Keep hardware clean and dry.
- Separate damaged or retired items immediately.
- Label bins and cases clearly.

Good organization prevents unsafe substitutions.


Retirement & Removal from Service
=================================

- Remove hardware permanently if damaged.
- Do not attempt to repair structural hardware.
- Cut or destroy retired items to prevent reuse.
- Document retirement when required.

When in doubt, retire it.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Rigging Technicians
-------------------

- Inspect and use hardware correctly.
- Report damage immediately.
- Follow approved rigging plans.

Lead Riggers
------------

- Verify hardware selection.
- Oversee inspections.
- Enforce safety standards.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect hardware during prep.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove unsafe hardware from circulation.

Project Managers
----------------

- Ensure appropriate hardware is specified.
- Verify qualified personnel.


Quality Control
===============

- No unrated hardware in use.
- Inspections performed consistently.
- Damaged hardware removed immediately.
- Safety violations corrected on the spot.

Rigging hardware quality directly affects safety.

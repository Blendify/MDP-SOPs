Technical Departments
*********************

The Technical Departments section documents all procedures, standards, and best practices for the
core technical disciplines at Maryland Productions and Event Revolution. These departments—Lighting,
Audio, Video, Power, and Rigging—are responsible for designing, preparing, deploying, and operating
the technical systems that bring events to life.

This chapter provides high-level overviews, safety guidelines, prep standards, and operational
procedures for each discipline. It ensures that all technicians, project managers, warehouse staff,
and freelancers follow consistent, professional, and safe practices across every show.


Purpose
=======

- Establish consistent technical standards across all MP and RV departments.
- Provide a unified reference for prep, on-site operation, and teardown procedures.
- Ensure safety and quality in the handling and deployment of technical equipment.
- Define clear expectations for technicians, leads, and department specialists.
- Support efficient collaboration between departments during multi-discipline events.
- Provide onboarding material for new crew members and freelancers.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Lighting, Audio, Video, Rigging, and Power technicians  
- Crew Leads and Department Heads  
- Warehouse prep teams  
- Project Managers and Technical Directors  
- Freelancers and new staff learning MP/RV workflows  

Anyone involved in prepping, transporting, operating, or striking show-critical equipment should be

Department Structure
====================

This chapter is divided into five major technical disciplines:

1. **Lighting**  
   Covers fixtures, consoles, data networks, power distribution, addressing, focusing, and show-file
   practices.

2. **Audio**  
   Includes speakers, amplifiers, consoles, RF coordination, cabling standards, and system prep.

3. **Video**  
   Covers LED walls, projectors, switching, camera systems, signal flow, and processing standards.

4. **Rigging**  
   Includes chain motors, truss systems, spansets, steel, load handling, safety rules, and inspection
   protocols.

5. **Power Distribution**  
   Covers camlock, feeder cable, distro operation, multi-cable handling, load balancing, and safety
   requirements.

Each department includes:
- Prep and testing standards  
- On-site operation guidelines  
- Safety and compliance rules  
- Cabling and labeling standards  
- Show file or configuration expectations  
- Troubleshooting workflows  
- Equipment-specific SOPs (fixtures, consoles, processors, motors, etc.)


Technical Philosophy
====================

Across all departments, MP/RV technical standards follow these principles:

- **Safety first** – No task is more important than safe operation.
- **Consistency** – Identical tasks should be completed using the same repeatable methods.
- **Cleanliness** – Gear is kept show-ready, clean, labeled, and professional in appearance.
- **Documentation** – All work, configs, and show files are documented and archived.
- **Communication** – Clear and timely communication is expected at every stage.
- **Professionalism** – Technicians represent the company on and off site.

These principles apply whether working small rentals or large multi-truck productions.

Projection Systems
******************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, deploying, operating, and resetting
**projection systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Projection
systems require careful planning, alignment, and environmental control to achieve bright, sharp,
and distortion-free images.

Projection issues are highly visible and must be prevented through disciplined setup and testing.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable and high-quality projected images.
- Prevent damage to projectors and lenses.
- Standardize projection setup, alignment, and operation.
- Define safety and handling requirements.
- Support consistent results across venues and event types.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video technicians  
- Video leads / V1s  
- Projection specialists  
- Warehouse staff prepping projection equipment  
- Rigging and power teams interfacing with projectors  
- Project Managers overseeing projection scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone handling or operating projectors must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Front and rear projection systems
- Projectors and lenses
- Projection mounts and hardware
- Screens (fast-fold, fixed, flown)
- Signal processing and scaling for projection

Rigging hardware is covered under Rigging SOPs.


Projection Safety Fundamentals
==============================

- Secure all projectors and mounts properly.
- Verify load ratings for flown or mounted projectors.
- Maintain adequate ventilation.
- Avoid direct exposure to projector lenses.
- Protect projectors from moisture and impact.

Projectors are powerful and fragile devices.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect projectors for:
  - Physical damage  
  - Lens integrity  
  - Air filter condition  
- Verify:
  - Correct lens selection  
  - Firmware versions  
  - Lamp or laser status  
- Test projectors with known content.
- Pack projectors with:
  - Proper cases  
  - Lens caps  
  - Power and signal cables  
- Label cases clearly.

No projector leaves the warehouse untested.


System Planning
===============

- Confirm:
  - Screen size and aspect ratio  
  - Throw distance  
  - Brightness requirements (ambient light)  
- Select appropriate:
  - Projector model  
  - Lens type  
- Determine:
  - Mounting method  
  - Rigging or stacking needs  
- Coordinate with:
  - Rigging  
  - Power  
  - Content providers  

Projection planning must be precise.


Screen Deployment
=================

- Assemble screens according to manufacturer guidelines.
- Ensure screens are:
  - Square  
  - Tensioned properly  
  - Clean and undamaged  
- Verify screen orientation and masking.

Screen quality affects image quality.


Projector Placement & Alignment
===============================

Placement
---------

- Position projectors accurately.
- Ensure stable mounting.
- Verify sightlines and clearance.
- Maintain ventilation space.

Placement errors affect focus and geometry.


Alignment
---------

- Align projector to screen center.
- Adjust lens shift carefully.
- Focus across the entire image.
- Minimize keystone correction.

Physical alignment beats digital correction.


Signal & Scaling
================

- Verify source resolution and frame rate.
- Set correct scaling and aspect ratio.
- Manage EDID intentionally.
- Avoid unnecessary conversions.

Scaling errors degrade image quality.


Testing & Verification
======================

- Display test patterns.
- Verify:
  - Sharp focus  
  - Uniform brightness  
  - Correct color  
- Test backup signal paths if applicable.
- Verify content playback.

Testing prevents public issues.


Operational Monitoring
======================

- Monitor image quality throughout the event.
- Watch for:
  - Focus drift  
  - Brightness changes  
  - Signal loss  
- Address issues promptly and methodically.

Projection systems can drift over time.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down projectors properly.
- Allow projectors to cool.
- Disconnect cables carefully.
- Inspect equipment during strike.
- Pack projectors securely.

Improper shutdown damages projectors.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport projectors in protective cases.
- Keep lenses capped.
- Store in climate-controlled areas.
- Maintain organized storage.

Proper handling extends projector lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy and align projectors correctly.
- Follow setup and safety standards.
- Report issues immediately.

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Design and oversee projection systems.
- Approve alignment and scaling.
- Coordinate with PMs and other departments.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset projectors and screens.
- Maintain lens and accessory inventory.
- Remove damaged equipment from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define projection scope and expectations.
- Coordinate logistics and scheduling.
- Support safety-driven decisions.


Quality Control
===============

- Projectors tested before use.
- Alignment and focus verified.
- Signal paths documented.
- Issues logged post-show.

Projection quality reflects attention to detail.

Video Playback
**************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, configuring, operating, and resetting
**video playback systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Video
playback systems often carry show-critical content and must be stable, predictable, and fully tested
before doors.

Playback failures are immediately visible and unacceptable.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable playback of all show-critical video content.
- Prevent failures caused by incorrect routing, scaling, or file issues.
- Standardize playback workflows across operators and events.
- Support redundancy and failover when required.
- Maintain consistent image quality and timing.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video leads / V1s  
- Playback operators  
- Video technicians  
- Warehouse staff prepping playback systems  
- Project Managers overseeing playback-heavy shows  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone responsible for triggering or routing video playback must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Computer-based playback systems
- Dedicated media servers
- Playback laptops and rack systems
- Video playback software
- Playback interfaces and converters
- Backup playback systems
- Timecode- or show-control-synced playback

Audio playback routing is covered under Audio SOPs.


Video Playback Safety
=====================

- Protect playback devices from power loss.
- Use conditioned or UPS-backed power when required.
- Disable system sleep, screen savers, and notifications.
- Secure playback devices physically.
- Avoid software updates immediately before shows.

Playback stability is more important than new features.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Verify playback devices boot correctly.
- Confirm:
  - Required software versions  
  - Valid licenses  
  - GPU and output configuration  
- Test video outputs with known content.
- Pack:
  - Power supplies  
  - Output adapters  
  - Control devices  
  - Backup media  
- Label playback cases clearly.

Playback systems must leave the warehouse show-ready.


Media Preparation
=================

- Verify video files for:
  - Resolution  
  - Frame rate  
  - Codec compatibility  
  - Aspect ratio  
- Rename files clearly and consistently.
- Load content in correct show order.
- Test files in the actual playback software.

Never assume client-provided files are ready.


System Configuration
====================

- Disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and auto-updates unless required.
- Lock OS and application settings when possible.
- Configure output resolutions explicitly.
- Verify color space and frame sync.

System configuration affects output quality.


Playback Routing
================

- Route playback outputs to dedicated switcher inputs.
- Avoid shared signal paths with other sources.
- Label playback channels clearly.
- Verify signal presence at all destinations.

Clear routing prevents operator error.


Redundancy & Backup
===================

- Provide backup playback for critical content.
- Maintain secondary playback devices when required.
- Test failover paths.
- Keep backups powered and ready.

Redundancy protects the show.


Testing & Rehearsal
===================

- Test every playback cue.
- Verify timing with show flow.
- Confirm scaling and image quality on final displays.
- Re-test after any system change.

Playback must be rehearsed.


Operation During Show
=====================

- Monitor playback system status.
- Avoid unnecessary software interaction.
- Confirm cue readiness before triggering.
- Communicate with show caller and PM.

Playback operation must be deliberate.


Troubleshooting Playback Issues
===============================

When issues occur:

- Verify playback device output.
- Check routing and switcher inputs.
- Confirm file playback status.
- Switch to backup system if required.

Do not aggressively troubleshoot live playback.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down devices properly.
- Save any updated show files.
- Inspect equipment during strike.
- Reset systems to default state.

Reset prepares systems for the next job.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport playback devices in protective cases.
- Store media and backups securely.
- Keep accessories organized and labeled.

Playback gear requires careful handling.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Approve playback system design.
- Verify routing and redundancy.
- Coordinate with PMs and show callers.

Playback Operators

- Redundancy in place when required.
- Scaling and routing verified.
- Issues documented post-show.

Playback reliability protects show integrity.

Video
*****

The Video department is responsible for the design, preparation, deployment, operation, and teardown
of all visual display and signal systems used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).
Video systems are highly visible, technically complex, and often integrated with audio, lighting,
and scenic elements.

This section documents department-wide standards for video prep, signal flow, processing, and
on-site operation to ensure consistent, reliable, and professional results.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable and high-quality video presentation across all events.
- Standardize video system prep, configuration, and operation.
- Prevent failures caused by signal integrity, scaling, or routing errors.
- Define clear expectations for video technicians and leads.
- Support efficient coordination with audio, lighting, rigging, and power teams.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Video technicians  
- Video leads / V1s  
- LED wall and projection specialists  
- Camera and playback operators  
- Warehouse staff prepping video equipment  
- Project Managers overseeing video scope  
- Freelancers operating MP/RV video systems  

Anyone handling video signal paths, displays, or processing should follow the standards in this
chapter.


Scope of Video Systems
======================

This section covers:

- LED wall systems (tiles, processors, power, data)
- Projection systems (projectors, lenses, screens)
- Video switchers and mixers
- Scalers and converters
- Camera systems
- Playback and media servers
- SDI, HDMI, and fiber signal paths
- Video networking and control
- Monitoring and confidence displays

This section does **not** replace manufacturer documentation or venue-specific requirements.


Video Safety Fundamentals
=========================

- Secure all displays and mounts properly.
- Verify load ratings for flown or stacked displays.
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy components.
- Protect equipment from moisture and impact.
- Maintain safe cable routing to prevent trip hazards.

Video systems can be heavy, fragile, and safety-critical.


Video Department Philosophy
===========================

MP/RV video standards follow these principles:

- **Signal Integrity** – Clean, properly scaled signals end-to-end.
- **Redundancy** – Backups where failure is unacceptable.
- **Consistency** – Repeatable layouts and workflows.
- **Documentation** – Signal paths, mappings, and configs recorded.
- **Coordination** – Tight integration with audio, lighting, and power.
- **Professionalism** – Clean, organized, client-facing setups.

Good video is deliberate, not improvised.


Video Prep Standards
====================

Warehouse Prep
--------------

- Inspect all video equipment before packing.
- Verify:
  - LED tiles and panels  
  - Processors and switchers  
  - Projector operation and lenses  
  - Cables and converters  
- Confirm firmware versions where applicable.
- Test signal flow for complete systems.
- Pack equipment by system and function.
- Label cases clearly by role or destination.

No video gear leaves the warehouse untested.


System Planning
===============

- Review event requirements:
  - Content type and resolution  
  - Screen size and aspect ratio  
  - Camera and IMAG needs  
  - Playback sources  
- Determine:
  - Display technology  
  - Processing and switching needs  
  - Control locations  
- Coordinate rigging, power, and networking early.

Video planning must happen early in the process.


On-Site Video Operations
========================

Load-In & Setup
---------------

- Verify display placement and orientation.
- Assemble displays according to manufacturer guidelines.
- Run video cabling cleanly and logically.
- Maintain service access to processors and switchers.
- Label signal paths clearly.

Clean setup enables fast troubleshooting.


Signal Flow & Scaling
---------------------

- Verify source resolutions and frame rates.
- Apply correct scaling and EDID management.
- Avoid unnecessary conversions.
- Test every signal path end-to-end.

Most video issues are signal flow issues.


Monitoring & Quality Control
============================

- Monitor image quality continuously.
- Watch for:
  - Signal loss  
  - Artifacts  
  - Color or brightness inconsistencies  
- Verify sync between multiple displays.
- Address issues promptly and methodically.

Video problems are immediately visible.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down systems in proper order.
- Disassemble displays carefully.
- Inspect equipment during strike.
- Note any damage or issues.
- Reset systems to show-ready condition.

Strike is part of the equipment lifecycle.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy and operate video systems safely.
- Follow signal flow and setup standards.
- Report issues immediately.

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Design and oversee video systems.
- Manage processors, switchers, and mappings.
- Coordinate with PMs and other departments.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define video scope and expectations.
- Coordinate logistics and scheduling.
- Support technical decisions.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset video equipment.
- Maintain organized storage.
- Remove damaged gear from service.


Quality Control
===============

- All systems tested before doors.
- Signal paths documented.
- Content verified.
- Issues logged and addressed post-show.

Video quality reflects directly on the company.

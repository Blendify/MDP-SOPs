Video Troubleshooting
*********************

This SOP defines the standardized approach for diagnosing and resolving **video system issues**
during prep, setup, rehearsal, and live operation. Effective troubleshooting requires methodical
thinking, clear communication, and adherence to signal flow fundamentals.

Random adjustments and guesswork create cascading failures.


Purpose
=======

- Resolve video issues quickly and safely.
- Minimize visible disruptions during live events.
- Prevent repeated or cascading failures.
- Standardize troubleshooting methodology across operators.
- Support clear post-show reporting and improvement.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video leads / V1s  
- Switcher, playback, and camera operators  
- Video technicians  
- Warehouse staff assisting with prep diagnostics  
- Project Managers supporting live troubleshooting  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone responding to video issues must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to all video system components, including:

- Playback systems
- Camera systems
- Switchers and routers
- LED processors and projectors
- Scalers and converters
- Video cabling (SDI, HDMI, fiber)
- Monitoring and distribution systems


Troubleshooting Principles
==========================

Always follow these rules:

- Stay calm.
- Change **one thing at a time**.
- Follow the signal path logically.
- Verify before adjusting.
- Communicate clearly with the team.

Panic causes mistakes.


Initial Assessment
==================

When an issue is reported:

- Identify:
  - What is affected?  
  - When did it start?  
  - Is it constant or intermittent?  
- Determine scope:
  - Single display  
  - Single source  
  - Entire system  

Scope determines strategy.


Follow the Signal Flow
======================

Start at the source and move downstream:

1. Source (playback or camera)
2. Cable
3. Switcher or router
4. Scaler or processor
5. Distribution
6. Display

Verify each stage before moving on.


Common Issues & Checks
======================

No Signal
---------

- Verify source output.
- Check input selection and routing.
- Inspect cable integrity.
- Confirm display input selection.

Wrong Format
------------

- Check resolution and frame rate.
- Verify EDID settings.
- Confirm display compatibility.
- Re-scale deliberately if required.

Image Artifacts
---------------

- Inspect cable quality and length.
- Check for bandwidth limits.
- Verify processor settings.
- Swap suspect components.

Flicker or Sync Issues
----------------------

- Verify refresh rates.
- Check genlock or sync settings.
- Confirm consistent frame rates.
- Inspect power stability.

Color or Brightness Issues
--------------------------

- Verify color space settings.
- Check processor calibration.
- Inspect display settings.
- Confirm content integrity.


LED Wall Specific Issues
========================

- Check tile power and data connections.
- Verify sender/receiver card mapping.
- Inspect processor warnings.
- Replace known-bad tiles.

Address LED issues immediately.


Projection-Specific Issues
==========================

- Verify focus and alignment.
- Check lens and projector settings.
- Inspect screen condition.
- Confirm brightness levels.

Projection issues may drift over time.


Camera-Specific Issues
======================

- Verify camera output format.
- Check power and CCU status.
- Inspect cabling.
- Confirm shading and white balance.

Camera consistency matters.


Playback-Specific Issues
========================

- Confirm playback device output.
- Verify correct cue is loaded.
- Check routing and scaling.
- Switch to backup system if needed.

Do not aggressively troubleshoot live playback.


Escalation & Communication
==========================

- Inform the Video Lead immediately.
- Communicate clearly and concisely.
- Escalate to PM if:
  - Safety is affected  
  - Show flow is impacted  
- Avoid side conversations during critical moments.

Clear communication speeds resolution.


Post-Issue Documentation
========================

After resolving the issue:

- Document:
  - What happened  
  - Root cause  
  - Resolution  
- Note any equipment needing service.
- Share findings with warehouse and leadership.

Documentation prevents repeat issues.


When to Stop & Reset
====================

- If multiple systems are affected:
  - Stop and reassess  
  - Reset to last known-good configuration  
- Do not chase symptoms endlessly.

Sometimes reset is the fastest solution.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Direct troubleshooting efforts.
- Make final technical decisions.
- Communicate with PM and production.

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Execute troubleshooting steps.
- Report findings accurately.
- Avoid unauthorized changes.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Support prep diagnostics.
- Service or flag problematic gear.

Project Managers
----------------

- Support troubleshooting decisions.
- Manage client expectations if required.


Quality Control
===============

- Issues addressed methodically.
- Root causes identified.
- Equipment issues logged.
- SOPs updated if patterns emerge.

Good troubleshooting improves future shows.

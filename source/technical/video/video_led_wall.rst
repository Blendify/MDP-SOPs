LED Wall Systems
****************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, deploying, operating, and resetting
**LED wall systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). LED walls are
high-impact, high-density systems that require precise handling, configuration, and verification to
ensure image quality and safety.

LED wall issues are highly visible and must be prevented through disciplined workflows.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable, high-quality LED wall performance.
- Prevent damage to tiles, processors, and supporting hardware.
- Standardize LED wall assembly, configuration, and testing.
- Define clear safety and handling requirements.
- Support consistent results across venues and event types.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video technicians  
- Video leads / V1s  
- LED wall specialists  
- Warehouse staff prepping LED systems  
- Rigging and power teams interfacing with LED walls  
- Project Managers overseeing LED wall scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone handling LED tiles, processors, or supporting systems must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- LED tiles and panels
- LED frames and hanging hardware
- LED processors and controllers
- Data distribution (sender/receiver cards)
- Power distribution for LED systems
- Ground-stacked and flown LED walls

Rigging hardware is covered under Rigging SOPs.


LED Wall Safety Fundamentals
============================

- LED walls must be properly supported and secured.
- Never exceed manufacturer load limits.
- Use approved frames, clamps, and hardware only.
- Keep LED systems protected from moisture.
- Maintain safe access around walls during operation.

LED walls are heavy and fragile.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect LED tiles for:
  - Physical damage  
  - Pixel issues  
  - Connector integrity  
- Verify:
  - Matching tile models and pixel pitch  
  - Spare tiles availability  
- Test tiles and panels for:
  - Power  
  - Data  
  - Uniform brightness  
- Inspect processors, sender cards, and cables.
- Pack tiles in proper cases with padding.
- Label cases clearly by tile type and quantity.

No LED wall leaves the warehouse untested.


System Planning
===============

- Confirm:
  - Wall dimensions (width × height)  
  - Resolution and aspect ratio  
  - Pixel pitch suitability for viewing distance  
- Determine:
  - Processor type and capacity  
  - Data and power requirements  
  - Rigging or ground support method  
- Coordinate with:
  - Rigging team  
  - Power team  
  - Content providers  

LED walls require early coordination.


LED Wall Assembly
=================

Ground-Stacked Walls
--------------------

- Assemble frames on level surfaces.
- Secure base supports properly.
- Lock tiles fully into frames.
- Prevent wall movement or tipping.

Never free-stack LED tiles.


Flown Walls
-----------

- Use manufacturer-approved hanging frames.
- Verify load calculations and pick points.
- Coordinate lifts with rigging team.
- Inspect all connections before load is overhead.

Flown LED walls require heightened safety.


Power Distribution
==================

- Verify correct voltage and connector types.
- Balance power loads across circuits.
- Label power runs clearly.
- Avoid sharing circuits with unrelated systems.

Power stability affects image reliability.


Data Distribution
=================

- Verify correct sender/receiver card mapping.
- Use approved data cables and lengths.
- Maintain consistent data flow direction.
- Label data paths clearly.

Data errors often present as tile failures.


Processor Configuration
=======================

- Set correct:
  - Resolution  
  - Refresh rate  
  - Color space  
- Load appropriate calibration files.
- Verify brightness and color uniformity.
- Lock processor settings when possible.

Processor configuration defines image quality.


Testing & Verification
======================

- Test full wall before content playback.
- Verify:
  - No dead pixels or tiles  
  - Correct mapping  
  - Uniform color and brightness  
- Display test patterns.
- Test backup signal paths if applicable.

Testing prevents public failures.


Operational Monitoring
======================

- Monitor wall performance continuously.
- Watch for:
  - Tile dropouts  
  - Color shifts  
  - Power or data warnings  
- Address issues immediately and methodically.

Small issues can cascade quickly.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down systems properly.
- Disconnect data and power carefully.
- Remove tiles without forcing connectors.
- Inspect tiles during strike.
- Pack tiles with protective padding.
- Document any damage or pixel issues.

Strike is critical for asset longevity.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Handle tiles by frames, not LEDs.
- Never stack tiles unprotected.
- Store tiles in designated cases.
- Keep tiles clean and dry.
- Maintain organized storage by tile type.

Proper handling preserves image quality.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Assemble and operate LED walls safely.
- Follow configuration and testing standards.
- Report issues immediately.

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Design and oversee LED wall systems.
- Configure processors and mappings.
- Coordinate with PMs, rigging, and power teams.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset LED wall equipment.
- Maintain tile inventory and spares.
- Remove damaged tiles from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define LED wall scope and expectations.
- Coordinate logistics and scheduling.
- Support safety-driven decisions.


Quality Control
===============

- All tiles tested before use.
- Wall mapping verified.
- Processor settings documented.
- Issues logged post-show.

LED wall quality is immediately visible.

Camera Systems
**************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, deploying, operating, and resetting
**camera systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Camera systems are
often integral to IMAG, streaming, recording, and broadcast workflows and must be configured
consistently to ensure stable, high-quality output.

Camera failures are immediately visible and disruptive to the show.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable and consistent camera operation.
- Standardize camera setup, signal paths, and configuration.
- Prevent failures caused by power, cabling, or format mismatches.
- Protect camera equipment from damage.
- Support predictable integration with video switching and playback systems.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video technicians  
- Video leads / V1s  
- Camera operators  
- Warehouse staff prepping camera systems  
- Project Managers overseeing camera scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone handling or operating cameras must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Studio and broadcast cameras
- PTZ cameras
- Handheld and tripod-mounted cameras
- Camera control units (CCUs)
- Camera power systems
- SDI, HDMI, and fiber camera signal paths
- Tally and intercom integration

Rigging hardware is covered under Rigging SOPs.


Camera Safety Fundamentals
==========================

- Secure all cameras and mounts properly.
- Verify tripod, pedestal, or mount stability.
- Manage cables to prevent trip hazards.
- Protect cameras from moisture and impact.
- Use proper lifting techniques for heavy cameras.

Unsecured cameras present safety and liability risks.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect cameras for:
  - Physical damage  
  - Lens condition  
  - Connector integrity  
- Verify:
  - Correct lenses and accessories  
  - Batteries and chargers  
  - CCUs and control cables  
- Test:
  - Video output  
  - Power options  
  - Basic camera functions  
- Pack cameras with:
  - Lens caps  
  - Power supplies  
  - Cables and accessories  
- Label cases clearly.

No camera leaves the warehouse untested.


System Planning
===============

- Confirm camera requirements:
  - Number of cameras  
  - Coverage areas  
  - IMAG vs broadcast needs  
- Determine:
  - Camera placement  
  - Mounting method  
  - Cable paths  
- Coordinate with:
  - Video switching  
  - Audio (for embedded audio)  
  - Power and rigging teams  

Camera planning must align with overall video design.


Camera Placement & Mounting
===========================

Tripods & Pedestals
-------------------

- Verify tripod load ratings.
- Level tripods properly.
- Lock all adjustments.
- Secure camera cables to prevent strain.

Stable support ensures image quality.


Fixed & Flown Cameras
---------------------

- Use approved mounts and hardware.
- Verify load ratings and safety cables.
- Coordinate lifts with rigging team.
- Confirm safe access for adjustment.

Flown cameras require heightened safety.


PTZ Cameras
===========

- Mount PTZ cameras securely.
- Verify control network connections.
- Label camera IDs clearly.
- Test pan, tilt, zoom, and presets.

PTZ reliability depends on setup accuracy.


Power & Signal Integration
==========================

- Verify correct power type:
  - Battery  
  - AC adapter  
  - CCU power  
- Avoid shared circuits with high-draw devices.
- Use approved signal cable types and lengths.
- Label camera signals clearly at both ends.

Power and signal issues often present as camera failures.


Camera Configuration
====================

- Match:
  - Resolution  
  - Frame rate  
  - Color space  
- Configure white balance and exposure.
- Disable unnecessary overlays.
- Lock settings when possible.

Configuration consistency simplifies switching.


Testing & Verification
======================

- Verify video output on monitors.
- Confirm signal at switcher inputs.
- Check tally and intercom when applicable.
- Perform camera shading if required.

Testing prevents on-air issues.


Operational Monitoring
======================

- Monitor camera performance during the event.
- Watch for:
  - Signal loss  
  - Color shifts  
  - Focus issues  
- Communicate issues immediately.
- Avoid unauthorized setting changes.

Camera operation requires discipline.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Power down cameras properly.
- Disconnect cables carefully.
- Inspect cameras during strike.
- Clean lenses and bodies as needed.
- Reset cameras to default or template settings.

Reset prepares cameras for the next show.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport cameras in padded cases.
- Keep lenses capped.
- Store batteries properly.
- Maintain organized accessory kits.

Proper handling protects image quality.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy and operate cameras safely.
- Follow placement and configuration standards.
- Report issues immediately.

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Design and oversee camera systems.
- Approve camera configuration.
- Coordinate with switcher and PMs.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset camera systems.
- Maintain camera and accessory inventory.
- Remove damaged equipment from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define camera scope and expectations.
- Coordinate logistics and scheduling.


Quality Control
===============

- Cameras tested before use.
- Configuration verified and documented.
- Signals confirmed at switcher.
- Issues logged post-show.

Camera quality directly affects production value.

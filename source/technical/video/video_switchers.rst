Video Switchers & Mixers
************************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for preparing, configuring, operating, and resetting
**video switchers and mixers** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Video
switchers are the central routing and control point for live content, playback, and camera feeds and
must be configured carefully to ensure reliable and predictable operation.

Switcher misconfiguration can disrupt the entire video system.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure reliable switching between video sources.
- Standardize switcher setup, routing, and show operation.
- Prevent signal loss, format mismatches, and timing issues.
- Protect switcher hardware and show files.
- Support consistent workflows across operators and events.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video leads / V1s  
- Switcher operators  
- Video technicians assisting with setup  
- Warehouse staff prepping switchers  
- Project Managers overseeing video scope  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone configuring or operating a video switcher must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Production video switchers
- Presentation switchers
- Broadcast switchers
- Control surfaces and frames
- Multi-viewers and monitoring outputs
- Associated control software

Manufacturer-specific workflows are documented separately.


Video Switcher Safety
=====================

- Protect switchers from moisture and impact.
- Use proper lifting techniques for large frames.
- Provide clean, stable power (UPS where required).
- Secure switchers on stable surfaces.
- Maintain adequate ventilation.

Switcher reliability depends on environment.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect switcher hardware for damage.
- Verify:
  - Power supplies  
  - Control panels  
  - Ports and connectors  
- Confirm firmware versions are approved.
- Test boot and basic operation.
- Pack switchers with:
  - Power cables  
  - Control and network cables  
  - Backup media  
- Label cases clearly.

Switchers must leave the warehouse fully functional.


Show File & Configuration Management
====================================

File Standards
--------------

- Use consistent naming:
  - `YYYY-MM-DD_Client_Event_Switcher`
- Never overwrite master templates.
- Maintain separate files for:
  - Rehearsal  
  - Show  
- Include configuration notes when supported.

Clear file management prevents mistakes.


File Storage
------------

- Store show files in:
  - Switcher internal storage  
  - External media  
  - Job folder in Google Workspace  
- Maintain backups whenever possible.

Never rely on a single copy.


System Setup
============

Placement
---------

- Place switchers in protected, accessible locations.
- Maintain clear sightlines to displays when required.
- Avoid blocking walkways.
- Coordinate FOH placement with PM and venue.

Operator ergonomics matter.


Power & Networking
------------------

- Use conditioned or UPS-backed power when required.
- Avoid shared circuits with high-draw devices.
- Verify control network topology.
- Label network connections clearly.

Stable power and control are critical.


Input & Output Configuration
============================

- Verify all input formats and resolutions.
- Match frame rates and color spaces.
- Configure outputs for:
  - LED walls  
  - Projectors  
  - Confidence monitors  
  - Broadcast feeds  
- Label all inputs and outputs clearly.

Format mismatches cause failures.


Multi-Viewer Configuration
==========================

- Assign logical layouts.
- Label sources clearly.
- Ensure operator can see all critical feeds.
- Test all preview and program paths.

Good monitoring prevents surprises.


Operation During Show
=====================

- Follow approved run-of-show.
- Avoid unnecessary configuration changes.
- Save changes periodically if supported.
- Communicate clearly with show caller and PM.

Switcher operation must be deliberate.


Redundancy & Backup
===================

- Provide backup switchers when required.
- Test failover paths.
- Maintain spare cables and control devices.

Critical shows require redundancy.


Troubleshooting Switcher Issues
===============================

When issues occur:

- Verify input signal presence.
- Check format compatibility.
- Confirm routing assignments.
- Inspect cables and converters.
- Switch to backup paths if available.

Do not guess—diagnose.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Save final show files.
- Power down switchers properly.
- Disconnect cables carefully.
- Inspect hardware during strike.
- Reset switchers to default or template state.

Reset prepares switchers for the next job.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Transport switchers in proper cases.
- Protect control surfaces and screens.
- Keep switchers clean and dry.
- Store in designated areas.

Proper handling extends switcher lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Design and oversee switching systems.
- Manage show files and routing.
- Coordinate with PMs and other departments.

Switcher Operators
------------------

- Operate switchers during the event.
- Follow run-of-show.
- Communicate issues immediately.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Prep, test, and reset switchers.
- Maintain firmware standards.
- Remove damaged switchers from service.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define switching requirements.
- Coordinate placement and logistics.


Quality Control
===============

- Switchers tested before doors.
- Inputs and outputs verified.
- Show files backed up.
- Issues documented post-show.

Reliable switching keeps the show on track.

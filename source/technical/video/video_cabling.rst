Video Cabling
*************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for selecting, handling, deploying, protecting, and
resetting **video cabling** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Video
signals are sensitive to cable type, length, and handling, and improper cabling is a common source
of signal loss and image degradation.

Clean, intentional cable management is essential for reliable video systems.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure stable, high-quality video signal transmission.
- Prevent cable-related signal failures and damage.
- Standardize video cable selection, routing, and labeling.
- Maintain professional, safe cable layouts.
- Extend the service life of MP/RV video cabling assets.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Video technicians  
- Video leads / V1s  
- Warehouse staff prepping video cable  
- Project Managers overseeing video layouts  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone deploying or handling video cabling must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- SDI cables (3G, 6G, 12G)
- HDMI cables
- Fiber optic video cables
- DisplayPort and DVI (when used)
- Video converters and adapters
- Patch cables and jumpers

Power cabling is covered under Power SOPs.


Video Cable Standards
=====================

- Use cable types rated for the required bandwidth.
- Observe maximum length specifications.
- Use fiber when distance or interference requires it.
- Avoid unnecessary adapters and format conversions.
- Never force connectors.

Correct cable choice prevents signal loss.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect cables for:
  - Jacket damage  
  - Bent or loose connectors  
  - Kinks or crushed sections  
- Test cables with known-good signals.
- Verify:
  - Clear length and type labels  
  - Ownership tags (MP / RV)  
- Coil cables properly using approved methods.
- Pack cables by type and length.

Damaged or marginal cables must be removed from service.


Cable Deployment
================

Routing
-------

- Route video cables away from power when possible.
- Avoid sharp bends and tight radii.
- Protect cables from foot traffic and lifts.
- Maintain service loops at connection points.
- Keep cable paths clean and logical.

Good routing prevents intermittent issues.


Strain Relief
-------------

- Provide strain relief at displays, processors, and switchers.
- Avoid tension on connectors.
- Secure cables to structures when appropriate.

Strain causes signal failure.


Connector Care
==============

- Keep connectors clean and capped when possible.
- Avoid contaminating fiber connectors.
- Inspect connectors before mating.
- Never hot-plug fiber connections.

Connector damage is often irreversible.


Fiber Optic Cabling
===================

- Use approved fiber types and lengths.
- Avoid sharp bends.
- Clean connectors before connection.
- Protect fiber from crushing or impact.
- Verify polarity and direction.

Fiber requires special care.


Adapters & Converters
=====================

- Minimize the use of adapters.
- Verify compatibility and orientation.
- Power converters properly.
- Label converters clearly.

Adapters are common failure points.


On-Site Monitoring
==================

- Monitor signals for:
  - Dropouts  
  - Sparkles  
  - Sync loss  
- Address issues immediately.
- Replace suspect cables promptly.

Video cable issues often worsen during shows.


Strike & Reset
==============

- Disconnect cables by connector bodies.
- Inspect cables during strike.
- Coil neatly and consistently.
- Separate damaged cables immediately.
- Return cables to proper storage.

Strike is the final inspection opportunity.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drag cables.
- Avoid tight or improper coiling.
- Store by type and length.
- Keep fiber in dedicated storage.
- Maintain organized storage locations.

Good handling extends cable lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Video Technicians
-----------------

- Deploy and handle cables properly.
- Maintain clean routing.
- Report cable issues immediately.

Video Leads / V1
----------------

- Approve cable layouts.
- Enforce cabling standards.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect, test, and reset cables.

Lighting Department
*******************

The Lighting Department designs, prepares, deploys, and operates all lighting systems for Maryland
Productions and Event Revolution. This includes conventional fixtures, moving lights, LED systems,
media-driven effects, data networks, and power distribution related to lighting.

This overview defines the core responsibilities, prep standards, safety rules, and operational
expectations for all lighting technicians and anyone interacting with lighting gear during warehouse
prep, truck loading, load-in, show operation, and strike.


Purpose
=======

- Establish consistent lighting practices across all MP/RV jobs.
- Ensure safe handling of fixtures, truss, cabling, and power.
- Standardize addressing, patching, testing, and labeling.
- Maintain show-ready equipment through proper prep and reset.
- Support clean, organized, and reliable lighting systems on-site.
- Provide a reference for onboarding new lighting technicians.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Lighting Technicians  
- Lead Lighting Programmers / Designers  
- Crew Leads  
- Warehouse Prep Staff  
- Project Managers advancing lighting requirements  
- Freelancers supporting lighting load-ins and strikes  

Any person responsible for handling, testing, or deploying lighting equipment should follow the
standards in this chapter.


Core Responsibilities
=====================

The Lighting Department is responsible for:

- Preparing all fixtures, power, and data before the show.
- Building lighting networks using DMX, RDM, Art-Net, and sACN.
- Ensuring proper addressing and labeling of all fixtures and universes.
- Configuring consoles, show files, and playback devices.
- Conducting focus, alignment, and testing on-site.
- Maintaining safety with truss, rigging hardware, and power distro.
- Completing clean and organized strikes, including case packing.


Lighting Equipment Categories
=============================

Lighting operations involve several main equipment types:

**Moving Lights**  
Spots, washes, hybrids, beams, and profiles used for dynamic effects.

**Static Fixtures**  
Pars, bars, ellipsoidals, uplights, LED battens, and architectural units.

**LED & Pixel Systems**  
Pixel bars, tape systems, props, and media-driven lighting effects.

**Consoles & Control**  
MA, Onyx, Chamsys, or other consoles, along with nodes, splitters, and networking.

**Power Distribution**  
Dimmers, relays, True1 distro, and cabling (Edison, PowerCON, True1, Camlock through Power).

**Rigging Interfaces**  
Clamps, safeties, cheeseboros, pipe, truss attachments, and fixture-specific rigging points.


Safety Standards
================

Lighting equipment involves electrical, mechanical, and rigging hazards. Mandatory safety rules:

- Always use proper PPE (gloves, steel-toe shoes).
- Never hang a fixture without a **rated safety cable**.
- Inspect clamps and hardware for cracks or deformities before use.
- Do not exceed load ratings for pipe, truss, or fixtures.
- Keep DMX and power separate from high-voltage or exposed conductor paths.
- Use proper ladders or lifts—never climb truss unsupported.
- Follow lockout/tagout when working on powered distro.


Pre-Show Prep Standards
=======================

Each lighting fixture must be:

- Cleaned (lens + exterior).
- Tested for all functions:
  - Pan/tilt  
  - Color mixing  
  - Zoom/focus  
  - Gobos  
  - Shutter/strobe  
- Checked for data ports, power connectors, and fans.
- Addressed and mode-set per the advance.
- Properly labeled for universe/channel.

Cables must be:

- Tested for continuity and signal.
- Coiled correctly.
- Sorted by length and labeled.
- Placed into proper trunks.

Cases must be:

- Clean, latched, and labeled with the job name.
- Loaded so that fixtures do not shift in transit.


On-Site Standards
=================

During load-in and show operation:

- Maintain clean cable runs and gaff paths.
- Avoid powering fixtures until they are properly hung and secured.
- All fixtures must have safeties before power is applied.
- Use DMX testers or console to verify signal paths.
- Patch must match the advance—changes must be communicated to PM or LD.
- Perform a full focus and alignment check before doors.


Strike & Reset
==============

After the show:

- Power off fixtures before unplugging.
- Coil cables cleanly—do not rush or drag.
- Remove safeties last.
- Protect lenses with covers or cloths.
- Return clamps and accessories to their bins.
- Pack fixtures correctly into cases.
- Document any damaged gear immediately.
- Perform reset & cleaning at the warehouse before shelving.


Common Lighting Documents & Files
=================================

- Patch sheets  
- Console show files  
- Universe layouts  
- Truss plots  
- Power distro maps  
- Focus charts

Feeder & Camlock Systems
************************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for handling, connecting, operating, and striking
**feeder cable and camlock-based power systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event
Revolution (RV). Feeder power involves high current and presents serious risk if handled improperly.

Only trained and authorized personnel may perform feeder or camlock connections.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure safe and correct connection of high-current feeder power.
- Prevent electrical shock, arc flash, equipment damage, and fire.
- Standardize camlock color order, handling, and verification.
- Define clear responsibilities for feeder power operations.
- Support compliance with venue rules and electrical best practices.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Power-qualified technicians  
- Lighting and video leads interfacing with distro systems  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing feeder power scope  
- Warehouse staff prepping feeder equipment  
- Authorized freelancers  

Unqualified personnel must not connect feeder power.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Single and multi-set camlock feeder
- Feeder cable (2/0, 4/0, or equivalent)
- Temporary event power tie-ins
- Generator feeder connections
- Distro feeder inputs

This SOP does **not** replace licensed electrician requirements where mandated by law.


Camlock Color Standards
=======================

Standard camlock color coding must always be followed:

- **Green** – Ground  
- **White** – Neutral  
- **Black** – Hot / Phase A  
- **Red** – Hot / Phase B  
- **Blue** – Hot / Phase C  

Never assume correctness — always verify.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained personnel may connect or disconnect camlocks.
- Generator or venue tie-ins may require additional authorization.
- Freelancers must demonstrate feeder experience.
- PMs must confirm qualified crew for feeder scope.

Improper feeder work is a zero-tolerance violation.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect feeder cable for:
  - Jacket damage  
  - Exposed conductors  
  - Connector integrity  
- Verify:
  - Correct color coding  
  - Clear length labels  
  - Ownership tags (MP / RV)  
- Coil feeder properly.
- Pack feeder separately from low-voltage cable.

Damaged feeder must not be deployed.


Pre-Connection Verification
===========================

Before connecting feeder:

- Confirm power source type:
  - Generator  
  - Venue service  
  - Temporary distro  
- Verify:
  - Voltage  
  - Phase  
  - Amperage  
- Confirm distro input matches supply.
- Verify source is **de-energized**.

Never connect feeder to live power unless explicitly authorized.


Connection Order
================

Camlocks must be connected in the following order:

1. **Ground (Green)**
2. **Neutral (White)**
3. **Hots (Black → Red → Blue)**

Disconnect in reverse order:

1. **Hots**
2. **Neutral**
3. **Ground**

This order is mandatory and non-negotiable.


Connection Best Practices
=========================

- Inspect connectors before mating.
- Fully seat connectors — no partial engagement.
- Keep connectors clean and dry.
- Avoid strain or tension on connectors.
- Support heavy feeder runs properly.

Loose connections create heat and failure risk.


Energization
============

- Energize only after all connections are verified.
- Stand clear of connectors during energization.
- Watch for:
  - Arcing  
  - Heat  
  - Noise  
- Shut down immediately if abnormalities occur.

Never ignore warning signs.


Generator Feeder Connections
============================

- Verify generator output configuration.
- Confirm grounding method.
- Coordinate startup and shutdown with generator operator.
- Monitor loads continuously.

Generators require constant oversight.


Feeder Routing & Protection
===========================

- Keep feeder off walkways when possible.
- Use ramps or mats where crossing paths.
- Avoid sharp bends and pinch points.
- Protect feeder from vehicles and lifts.
- Keep feeder dry and elevated when possible.

Physical damage leads to electrical failure.


Strike & Disconnection
======================

- Power down loads first.
- De-energize source completely.
- Disconnect in correct order.
- Inspect feeder during strike.
- Coil properly and pack dry.

Strike must be deliberate and controlled.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drag feeder.
- Protect connectors from impact.
- Coil using approved methods.
- Store feeder in designated cases or racks.
- Separate damaged cable immediately.

Good handling preserves safety and lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Power Technicians
-----------------

- Perform feeder connections safely.
- Verify source and distro compatibility.
- Monitor feeder during operation.

Department Leads
----------------

- Communicate power requirements.
- Coordinate load planning.
- Enforce feeder safety standards.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define feeder scope.
- Verify qualified personnel.
- Coordinate venue or generator access.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect and prep feeder cable.
- Maintain labeling and organization.
- Remove unsafe feeder from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No feeder connected by unqualified personnel.
- Correct camlock order enforced.
- Connections verified before energization.
- Issues corrected immediately.

Feeder mistakes can be catastrophic.

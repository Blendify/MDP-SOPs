Power Distribution Units (Distros)
**********************************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for the selection, setup, operation, monitoring, and
strike of **power distribution units (distros)** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event
Revolution (RV). Distros are the central interface between feeder power and show equipment and must
be configured correctly to ensure safe and reliable operation.

Improper distro use can result in equipment damage, tripped breakers, or unsafe conditions.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure distros are used safely and within their rated limits.
- Prevent overloads, phase imbalance, and incorrect connections.
- Standardize distro setup and labeling practices.
- Define clear responsibilities for power monitoring.
- Support coordination between all technical departments.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Power technicians  
- Lighting, audio, and video leads connecting to distros  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing power distribution  
- Warehouse staff prepping distros  
- Authorized freelancers  

Only trained personnel may configure and operate distros.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Main feeder distros
- Lighting distros
- Audio distros
- Breakout and spider boxes
- Temporary event distribution systems

This SOP does **not** replace electrical code requirements or licensed electrician work where
required.


Distro Safety Fundamentals
==========================

- Never exceed distro input or output ratings.
- All breakers must be operational and labeled.
- Neutral and ground integrity must be maintained.
- Distros must be properly grounded.
- Stop work authority applies to all power operations.

Distros protect both people and equipment.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained personnel may configure distros.
- High-current or multi-phase systems require advanced training.
- Freelancers must demonstrate distro experience.
- PMs must verify qualified crew for distro scope.

Improper distro configuration is unacceptable.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect distro exterior and internals for damage.
- Verify:
  - Input connectors  
  - Breaker operation  
  - Indicator lights  
  - Labeling and phase markings  
- Test breakers and GFCIs when applicable.
- Confirm distro matches job requirements.

Damaged distros must be removed from service.


Distro Placement
================

- Place distros on stable, level surfaces.
- Keep distros dry and protected.
- Maintain clear access to breakers.
- Avoid stacking distros unless designed for it.
- Secure distros to prevent tipping.

Accessibility is critical during operation.


Input Connection
================

- Verify distro input type and rating.
- Confirm feeder matches distro configuration.
- Connect feeder following camlock order.
- Verify neutral and ground before energization.
- Do not energize until all outputs are verified.

Input errors propagate throughout the system.


Output Configuration
====================

- Identify required output types and quantities.
- Balance loads across phases.
- Label outputs when multiple departments are connected.
- Avoid daisy-chaining distros unless rated.

Load balance is a safety and performance issue.


Breaker Management
==================

- Use breakers as intended—do not bypass.
- Trip breakers indicate a problem, not a nuisance.
- Identify and correct overloads before resetting.
- Never replace breakers with incorrect ratings.

Breakers exist to prevent damage and fire.


Monitoring During Operation
===========================

- Monitor distro status throughout the event.
- Watch for:
  - Tripped breakers  
  - Heat  
  - Noise  
  - Indicator warnings  
- Respond immediately to abnormalities.

Power systems require continuous oversight.


Department Coordination
=======================

- Lighting, audio, and video leads must communicate power needs.
- Changes in load must be approved.
- Avoid last-minute additions without review.

Uncoordinated changes cause failures.


Strike & Shutdown
=================

- Power down loads before shutdown.
- De-energize distro input.
- Disconnect outputs before feeder removal.
- Inspect distro during strike.
- Pack clean and dry.

Orderly shutdown prevents damage.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drop or impact distros.
- Protect connectors and breakers.
- Store in designated cases.
- Keep distros clean and labeled.

Good handling preserves reliability.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Power Technicians
-----------------

- Configure and monitor distros.
- Balance loads and respond to issues.
- Enforce distro safety standards.

Department Leads
----------------

- Communicate load requirements.
- Coordinate changes.
- Respect distro limits.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define distro scope.
- Verify qualified personnel.
- Coordinate venue requirements.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect and prep distros.
- Maintain labeling and organization.
- Remove unsafe distros from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No overloaded distros.
- Breakers functional and accessible.
- Loads balanced across phases.
- Issues corrected immediately.

Distro reliability protects the show.

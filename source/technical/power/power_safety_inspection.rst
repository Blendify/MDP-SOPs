Power Safety & Inspection
*************************

This SOP defines the safety practices, inspection requirements, and corrective actions for all
electrical power systems used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Power systems
present inherent hazards and must be inspected and monitored continuously to protect personnel,
equipment, and venues.

No power system may be energized unless it passes inspection.


Purpose
=======

- Prevent electrical injuries, fires, and equipment damage.
- Identify unsafe power conditions before and during operation.
- Standardize inspection procedures across all power systems.
- Define corrective actions for unsafe findings.
- Reinforce safety-first culture for electrical work.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Power technicians  
- Lighting, audio, and video leads interacting with power systems  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing power scope  
- Warehouse staff inspecting power equipment  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone working with or around power systems must understand these requirements.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Feeder and camlock systems
- Power distros and breakers
- Branch circuit cabling
- Generator connections
- Temporary event power systems
- Grounding and bonding systems

This SOP does **not** replace licensed electrician or local code requirements where mandated.


Power Safety Principles
=======================

- Treat all power as live until proven otherwise.
- Never work on energized systems unless explicitly authorized.
- Use appropriate PPE when required.
- Maintain clear access to disconnects and breakers.
- Stop work authority applies to all power operations.

Safety takes precedence over schedule.


Inspection Timing
=================

Power inspections must occur at the following times:

- **Warehouse Prep Inspection**
- **Pre-Energization Inspection**
- **Operational Inspection**
- **Post-Event / Strike Inspection**

Skipping inspections is not permitted.


Warehouse Prep Inspection
=========================

Inspect all power equipment before deployment:

- Feeder cable jackets and connectors
- Camlock color coding and integrity
- Distros and breakers
- Power cables and connectors
- Labels and ownership markings

Remove damaged equipment from service immediately.


Pre-Energization Inspection
===========================

Before energizing any power system:

- Verify source voltage and phase.
- Confirm grounding and neutral integrity.
- Check camlock order and seating.
- Verify distro configuration and breaker status.
- Ensure no exposed conductors.
- Confirm cable routing and protection.

Energization may proceed only after passing inspection.


Operational Inspection
======================

During the event, monitor for:

- Tripped breakers
- Excessive heat
- Arcing or noise
- Loose connectors
- Cable damage
- Water exposure

Issues must be addressed immediately.


Environmental Hazards
=====================

- Protect power from rain, snow, and moisture.
- Elevate connections where possible.
- Use weather-rated equipment when required.
- Suspend power work during unsafe conditions.

Environmental exposure increases risk.


Grounding & Bonding
===================

- Verify proper grounding at all sources and distros.
- Never lift grounds or neutrals.
- Confirm bonding between metallic systems.
- Follow venue grounding requirements.

Grounding protects both people and equipment.


Unsafe Conditions & Corrections
===============================

If an unsafe condition is found:

- De-energize affected systems immediately.
- Secure the area.
- Correct the issue before re-energizing.
- Escalate to leadership if required.

Never ignore safety concerns.


Incident Response
=================

In the event of an electrical incident:

- Stop work immediately.
- De-energize systems if safe to do so.
- Provide first aid or call emergency services as needed.
- Secure the scene.
- Report the incident per company policy.

Incident reporting is mandatory.


Documentation
=============

Document when required:

- Failed inspections
- Equipment removed from service
- Incidents or near misses
- Corrective actions taken

Documentation supports accountability and improvement.


Responsibilities
================

Power Technicians
-----------------

- Perform inspections and corrections.
- Monitor systems throughout the event.
- Enforce power safety standards.

Department Leads
----------------

- Coordinate power requirements.
- Support safety decisions.
- Communicate changes promptly.

Project Managers
----------------

- Ensure inspection requirements are met.
- Support safety-driven delays or shutdowns.

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Inspect power equipment during prep and reset.
- Remove unsafe equipment from service.


Quality Control
===============

- No power energized without inspection.
- Unsafe equipment removed immediately.
- Safety issues documented and addressed.
- Continuous monitoring enforced.

Power safety protects everyone.

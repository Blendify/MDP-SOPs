Power Distribution
******************

The Power department is responsible for the safe design, preparation, distribution, monitoring, and
shutdown of all electrical power systems used in MP/RV productions. Power work is safety-critical
and underpins every other technical discipline. Improper power distribution can result in injury,
equipment damage, show failure, or fire.

This section documents the standards and procedures for power systems from warehouse prep through
on-site operation and strike.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure safe and reliable electrical power distribution for all events.
- Prevent overloads, phase imbalance, and unsafe connections.
- Standardize power prep, labeling, and deployment practices.
- Define clear responsibilities for power-qualified personnel.
- Support coordination between lighting, audio, video, and rigging teams.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Power technicians  
- Lighting and video leads interfacing with distro systems  
- Technical Directors  
- Project Managers overseeing electrical scope  
- Warehouse staff prepping power equipment  
- Freelancers working with feeder, distro, or venue power  

Only trained and authorized personnel may work with power systems.


Scope of Power Systems
======================

This section covers:

- Feeder cable and camlock systems
- Power distribution units (distros)
- L21-30, 14-50, and Edison distribution
- Multi-cable and breakouts
- Grounding and bonding
- Load calculations and balancing
- Temporary power for events
- Power safety and inspection procedures

This section does **not** replace licensed electrician work where required by law.


Power Safety Fundamentals
=========================

- Safety is the highest priority in all power work.
- Verify voltage and phase before connection.
- Never assume power is correct or de-energized.
- Lockout/tagout procedures must be followed when applicable.
- PPE must be worn as required.
- Stop work authority applies to all power operations.

Unsafe power practices are not tolerated.


Training & Authorization
========================

- Only trained personnel may connect or disconnect feeder power.
- High-current systems require additional authorization.
- Freelancers must demonstrate competency before assignment.
- PMs must verify crew qualifications for power scope.

Unqualified personnel must not handle power connections.


Power Prep Standards
====================

Warehouse Prep
--------------

- Inspect feeder and distro equipment.
- Verify:
  - Connector integrity  
  - Cable jackets  
  - Labels and color coding  
- Test distro breakers and indicators.
- Pack cables by type and length.
- Label cases clearly.

No power gear leaves without inspection.


Labeling & Identification
-------------------------

- All power cables must be clearly labeled:
  - Type  
  - Length  
  - Ownership (MP / RV)  
- Camlocks must follow standard color coding.
- Distros must be labeled with:
  - Input type  
  - Output ratings  
  - Phase information  

Clear labeling prevents dangerous mistakes.


Load Planning & Coordination
============================

- Review power requirements for all departments.
- Calculate total and per-phase loads.
- Balance loads across phases.
- Coordinate with lighting, audio, video, and rigging.
- Confirm venue power availability and limitations.

Poor planning causes failures.


On-Site Power Operations
========================

Connection & Energization
-------------------------

- Verify power source is correct and approved.
- Inspect connectors before mating.
- Connect in proper order:
  - Ground  
  - Neutral  
  - Hots  
- Energize only after verification.
- Monitor for abnormal behavior.

Never rush energization.


Distribution & Monitoring
-------------------------

- Use appropriate distro for the application.
- Do not exceed rated capacities.
- Monitor loads during operation.
- Watch for heat, noise, or breaker trips.
- Keep power runs neat and protected.

Power must be continuously monitored.


Grounding & Bonding
===================

- Ensure proper grounding at all times.
- Verify neutral and ground integrity.
- Never lift grounds.
- Follow venue and local code requirements.

Grounding protects people and equipment.


Weather & Environmental Considerations
======================================

- Protect power equipment from rain and moisture.
- Elevate connections where possible.
- Use weather-rated equipment when required.
- Suspend work during unsafe conditions.

Water and electricity do not mix.


Strike & De-Powering
====================

- Power down loads before disconnecting.
- De-energize source before feeder removal.
- Disconnect in reverse order:
  - Hots  
  - Neutral  
  - Ground  
- Inspect cables during strike.
- Coil and pack properly.

Strike must be controlled and deliberate.


Power Equipment Handling
========================

- Do not drag feeder cable.
- Protect connectors from impact.
- Coil cables properly.
- Keep power gear clean and dry.
- Separate damaged cables immediately.

Handling affects safety and lifespan.


Roles & Responsibilities
========================

Power Technicians
-----------------

- Perform power connections safely.
- Monitor loads and systems.
- Report issues immediately.

Department Leads
----------------

- Communicate power requirements.
- Coordinate load planning.
- Enforce power safety standards.

Project Managers
----------------

- Define power scope.
- Verify qualified personnel.
- Coordinate venue requirements.

Quality Control
===============

- No unqualified power connections.
- All loads planned and balanced.
- Power systems monitored throughout events.
- Safety violations corrected immediately.

Power quality directly affects every department.

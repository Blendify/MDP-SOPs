Power Cabling
*************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for selecting, handling, deploying, protecting, and
striking **power cabling** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Proper power
cable management is critical for electrical safety, reliability, and professional presentation.

Improper cable handling can lead to shock hazards, equipment damage, and show interruptions.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure safe and reliable delivery of power to all systems.
- Prevent cable damage and electrical hazards.
- Standardize cable selection, routing, and labeling.
- Maintain professional and organized cable layouts.
- Extend the lifespan of MP/RV power cabling assets.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Power technicians  
- Lighting, audio, and video technicians handling power cabling  
- Warehouse staff prepping and resetting cables  
- Project Managers overseeing power layouts  
- Authorized freelancers  

Anyone deploying or handling power cabling must follow this SOP.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Feeder cable (covered in detail elsewhere)
- L21-30 cables
- 14-50 cables
- Edison (5-15 / 5-20) cables
- Multi-cable and breakouts
- Power extensions and jumpers

Low-voltage data cabling is covered in separate SOPs.


Power Cable Standards
=====================

- Use the correct cable type for the load.
- Never exceed rated amperage.
- Use outdoor-rated cable where required.
- Avoid adapters unless approved.
- Use GFCI protection when required.

Cable selection affects safety.


Warehouse Prep
==============

- Inspect cables for:
  - Cuts or abrasions  
  - Exposed conductors  
  - Connector damage  
  - Missing ground pins  
- Verify:
  - Correct labeling (type, length, MP/RV)  
  - Clean connectors  
- Coil cables properly.
- Pack by type and length.

Damaged cables must be removed from service.


Cable Deployment
================

Routing
-------

- Route cables along walls or edges when possible.
- Avoid high-traffic areas.
- Use cable ramps or mats when crossing paths.
- Avoid sharp bends and pinch points.
- Keep cables off standing water.

Good routing prevents hazards.


Strain Relief
-------------

- Provide strain relief at all connection points.
- Avoid tension on connectors.
- Support heavy cables appropriately.

Strain causes failure over time.


Connection Practices
====================

- Verify power is de-energized before connecting.
- Fully seat connectors.
- Do not force connections.
- Ensure locking connectors are engaged.
- Verify polarity and voltage where applicable.

Connections must be deliberate.


Cable Protection
================

- Use ramps, mats, or covers in traffic areas.
- Elevate cables in wet environments.
- Protect cables from vehicles and lifts.
- Do not tape over damaged insulation.

Protection reduces failure risk.


Load Awareness
==============

- Be aware of the load on each cable.
- Avoid overloading branch circuits.
- Communicate load changes to power lead.
- Do not daisy-chain power strips.

Overloads cause trips and hazards.


On-Site Monitoring
==================

- Periodically check cable runs.
- Look for heat buildup or damage.
- Verify connectors remain secure.
- Address issues immediately.

Cable issues often develop during shows.


Strike & Reset
==============

- De-energize circuits before disconnecting.
- Disconnect by the connector body, not the cable.
- Inspect cables during strike.
- Coil neatly and consistently.
- Separate damaged cables immediately.

Strike is the last inspection opportunity.


Handling & Storage
==================

- Do not drag cables.
- Avoid tight or improper coiling.
- Store by type and length.
- Keep cables clean and dry.
- Label clearly for inventory tracking.

Good handling extends cable life.

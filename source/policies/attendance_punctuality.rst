Attendance & Punctuality Policy
*******************************

The Attendance & Punctuality Policy establishes expectations for reliability, timeliness, and
communication for all individuals working with Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).
Live event production depends on coordinated schedules, crew availability, and precise timing.
Failure to arrive on time or as scheduled can disrupt operations, compromise safety, and negatively
impact clients.

Reliability is a core professional responsibility.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure events, warehouse operations, and administrative work run smoothly.
- Set clear expectations for attendance and punctuality.
- Promote accountability and professionalism.
- Define procedures for absences, lateness, and schedule changes.
- Reduce last-minute disruptions and safety risks.


Who This Policy Applies To
==========================

This policy applies to:

- Employees (full-time and part-time)
- Freelancers and independent contractors
- Temporary staff and interns
- Project Managers and Crew Leads
- Warehouse and administrative staff

Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment or engagement.


Attendance Expectations
=======================

All personnel are expected to:

- Report to work as scheduled.
- Be ready to work at the designated start time.
- Remain on-site and available for the full scheduled shift unless released.
- Complete assigned shifts unless excused or approved otherwise.

Accepting a call or assignment is a commitment.


Punctuality
===========

- Individuals must arrive **on time**, not early or late, unless instructed otherwise.
- “On time” means:
  - Arrived at the location  
  - Checked in as required  
  - Ready to begin work  
- Travel delays must be anticipated and planned for.

Repeated lateness is considered a performance issue.


Call Times & Job Schedules
==========================

- Call times are set by Project Managers or Crew Leads.
- Call times may vary based on job requirements.
- Schedule changes may occur due to client or venue needs.
- Individuals must remain reachable for updates when scheduled.

Failure to monitor communications is not an excuse for missed calls.


Absences
========

Planned Absences
----------------

- Planned absences must be communicated as early as possible.
- Employees should follow internal request procedures.
- Freelancers must decline work they are not available for.
- Approval is subject to operational needs.

Unplanned Absences
------------------

- Notify the Crew Lead or PM as soon as possible.
- Notification must occur **before** the scheduled start time when feasible.
- Provide a brief explanation for the absence.

No-call / no-show is a serious violation.


Lateness
========

If running late:

- Notify the Crew Lead or PM immediately.
- Provide an estimated arrival time.
- Do not assume lateness is acceptable without acknowledgment.

Chronic lateness may result in reduced work opportunities.


Early Departure
===============

- Leaving a job early requires approval from a Crew Lead or PM.
- Do not leave without being released.
- Unauthorized early departure may be treated as an absence.

Jobs must remain fully staffed for safety and operations.


Fatigue & Fitness for Duty
==========================

- Individuals must report fit for duty.
- Excessive fatigue that affects safety must be reported.
- Crew Leads may reassign or release individuals if fatigue poses a risk.

Fatigue management is a safety issue.


Communication Requirements
==========================

- Use approved communication channels.
- Monitor messages when scheduled.
- Respond promptly to time-sensitive communications.
- Keep contact information current.

Clear communication prevents scheduling failures.


Enforcement

Severity depends on frequency, impact, and role.

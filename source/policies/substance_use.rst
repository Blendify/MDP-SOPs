Substance Use Policy
********************

The Substance Use Policy establishes clear rules regarding the use of alcohol, drugs, and other
substances while working for Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Because company
work involves safety-sensitive activities, heavy equipment, vehicles, electrical systems, and
public-facing environments, impairment of any kind presents a serious risk.

Working while impaired is strictly prohibited.

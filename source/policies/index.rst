Company Policies
****************

The Company Policies chapter defines the formal rules, expectations, and standards that govern how
Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV) operate as organizations. These policies apply
across all departments and roles and are intended to protect employees, freelancers, clients,
assets, and the companies themselves.

Unlike SOPs, which describe *how* tasks are performed, company policies define *what is required*,
*what is permitted*, and *what is prohibited*.


Purpose
=======

- Establish clear expectations for conduct, safety, and professionalism.
- Ensure legal, ethical, and operational compliance.
- Provide consistency in decision-making across departments.
- Protect company assets, data, and reputation.
- Serve as a reference for resolving disputes or uncertainties.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Employees  
- Freelancers and contractors  
- Managers and supervisors  
- Project Managers and Crew Leads  
- Warehouse and technical staff  
- Administrative and sales staff  

All personnel working under MP or RV are expected to understand and comply with these policies.


Policy Scope
============

Company policies apply to:

- Warehouse operations
- On-site event work

Policies apply regardless of job title or employment classification unless explicitly stated
otherwise.


Relationship to SOPs
====================

- **Policies** define rules, obligations, and boundaries.
- **SOPs** define procedures and workflows.

If a conflict exists:

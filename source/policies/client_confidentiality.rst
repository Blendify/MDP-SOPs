Client Confidentiality Policy
*****************************

The Client Confidentiality Policy defines how Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV)
protect client information, proprietary materials, and sensitive project details. Clients entrust
MP/RV with confidential business information, creative assets, and operational data, and protecting
that trust is essential to maintaining professional relationships and legal compliance.

Confidentiality is a core professional obligation.


Purpose
=======

- Protect client information from unauthorized disclosure or misuse.
- Define what constitutes confidential client information.
- Establish clear rules for handling, sharing, and storing client data.
- Prevent reputational harm and legal exposure.
- Ensure consistent confidentiality practices across all departments.


Who This Policy Applies To
==========================

This policy applies to:

- Employees (full-time and part-time)
- Freelancers and independent contractors
- Temporary staff and interns
- Project Managers and Crew Leads
- Anyone with access to client information or materials

Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment or engagement.


What Is Considered Confidential
===============================

Confidential client information includes, but is not limited to:

- Client contact details and internal communications
- Contracts, proposals, and pricing
- Event budgets and scope details
- Technical designs, plots, and show files
- Schedules, run-of-show documents, and call sheets
- Security procedures or access information
- Client-provided assets (logos, media, branding)
- Non-public information learned through client interactions

Information does not need to be marked confidential to be protected.


Confidentiality Obligations
===========================

All personnel must:

- Use client information only for authorized business purposes.
- Share client information only with individuals who need it to perform their role.
- Protect client materials from loss, theft, or unauthorized access.
- Follow all applicable SOPs and data security policies.
- Treat all client projects as confidential unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Confidentiality applies both during and after engagement.


Disclosure & Sharing
====================

Permitted Disclosure
--------------------

Client information may be shared only when:

- It is necessary to perform assigned work.
- The recipient is authorized and has a legitimate business need.
- Disclosure is approved by a Project Manager or authorized manager.
- Required by law or legal process (management must be notified immediately).

Unauthorized Disclosure
-----------------------

The following are prohibited without explicit authorization:

- Sharing client information with third parties.
- Discussing client details with other clients.
- Posting client-related information publicly.
- Sharing internal pricing or budgets.
- Disclosing security or access information.

When in doubt, do not share.


Use of Client Materials
=======================

- Client materials may be used only for the specific project.
- Do not reuse client assets for other projects without permission.
- Do not retain copies of client materials after the project unless authorized.
- Client materials must be returned or deleted when required.

Client intellectual property must be respected.


Photography, Video & Social Media
=================================

- Do not photograph or record client events without approval.
- Do not post photos, videos, or behind-the-scenes content without authorization.
- Follow all client-specific media restrictions.
- Tagging or naming clients publicly requires approval.

Assume all events are private unless told otherwise.


On-Site Conduct
===============

- Do not discuss confidential client information in public areas.
- Be mindful of conversations around guests, venue staff, or other vendors.
- Protect documents and devices from being viewed by unauthorized individuals.
- Follow client-specific security or access rules.

Discretion on-site is essential.


Data Handling & Storage
=======================

- Store client data only in approved systems.
- Do not store client data on personal devices unless approved.
- Protect physical documents from loss or unauthorized access.
- Follow data retention and deletion requirements.

Improper handling increases risk of exposure.


Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)
================================

- Some clients require NDAs.
- NDAs must be followed strictly.
- If unsure whether an NDA applies, ask a PM or manager.
- Violations of NDAs may result in severe legal consequences.

NDAs override general confidentiality guidance where applicable.


Reporting Breaches
==================

If you believe client information has been compromised:

1. Report the issue immediately to a PM or manager.
2. Do not attempt to conceal or resolve the issue independently.
3. Follow instructions for containment and mitigation.

Prompt reporting reduces harm.


Enforcement
===========

Violations of this policy may result in:

- Removal from client projects
- Disciplinary action
- Termination of employment or contract
- Legal action where appropriate

Severity depends on the nature and impact of the violation.


Acknowledgement
===============

All personnel may be required to acknowledge this policy in writing. Failure to read or acknowledge
this policy does not exempt individuals from compliance.

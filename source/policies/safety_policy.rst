Safety Policy
*************

The Safety Policy establishes the mandatory safety standards and expectations for all work performed
by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Safety is the highest priority in all
operations, including warehouse work, transportation, load-in/load-out, rehearsals, live events,
and strike.

No deadline, budget, or client request overrides safety.


Purpose
=======

- Protect employees, freelancers, clients, and the public from injury.
- Prevent damage to equipment, venues, and property.
- Establish clear authority and responsibility for safety decisions.
- Ensure compliance with applicable safety regulations and best practices.
- Create a culture where safety concerns are encouraged and addressed promptly.

==========================

This policy applies to:

- Employees (full-time and part-time)
- Freelancers and contractors
- Project Managers and Crew Leads

Core Safety Principles
======================

- **Safety comes first** — Always.

IT & Systems
************

The IT & Systems chapter documents the digital infrastructure, software platforms, data practices,
and technical workflows that support Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). These
systems underpin nearly every aspect of operations—from sales and project management to inventory,
warehouse workflows, and internal communication.

This chapter defines how systems are used, maintained, secured, and documented to ensure reliability,
data accuracy, and continuity across teams.


Purpose
=======

- Establish clear standards for using company software and digital tools.
- Ensure data consistency across inventory, jobs, and financial systems.
- Reduce errors caused by misuse or misconfiguration of systems.
- Improve onboarding and cross-team collaboration.
- Protect company data, credentials, and intellectual property.
- Provide a single source of truth for system-related procedures.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Project Managers  
- Warehouse staff  
- Administrative staff  
- Sales & Client Experience team  
- Technicians interacting with inventory or job data  
- IT administrators or system owners  
- Leadership reviewing operational systems  

Anyone using MP/RV software platforms should be familiar with the SOPs in this chapter.


Core Systems Overview
=====================

MP/RV relies on a set of interconnected systems, each with a defined role.

Inventory & Job Systems
-----------------------

**Current RMS (MP)**  
- Quoting and estimating  
- Contracts and client documentation  
- Job scheduling  
- Invoicing  
- Asset tracking for MP-owned gear  

**Flex (RV)**  
- Asset-level inventory tracking  
- Barcode scanning (outbound and returns)  
- Maintenance and repair tracking  
- RV-owned equipment management  

These systems must remain synchronized through disciplined usage and accurate data entry.


Project & Task Management
-------------------------

**Monday.com**  
- Project tracking  
- Task assignments  
- Crew scheduling  
- Internal coordination  

Monday.com is used to visualize workload and prevent scheduling conflicts.


Communication Systems
---------------------

**Email (Google Workspace)**  
- Primary external communication with clients and vendors  
- Official record of agreements and approvals  

**Internal Messaging (Slack or equivalent)**  
- Day-to-day coordination  
- Urgent updates  
- Internal discussions  

Important decisions must always be documented outside chat.


File Storage & Documentation
----------------------------

**Google Drive / Shared Storage**  
- Job folders  
- Contracts and invoices  
- Advance packets  
- CAD drawings and plots  
- SOP documentation  

File organization standards are critical to avoid data loss and confusion.


Financial & Accounting Systems
------------------------------

- Invoicing and payment tracking  
- Deposits and reconciliation  
- Payroll coordination  
- Vendor payments  

Financial systems must reflect accurate data from Current RMS and Flex.


System Ownership & Permissions
==============================

Each system must have a designated **System Owner** responsible for:

- User access and permissions  
- Configuration changes  
- Training and documentation  
- Data integrity  

Access levels must follow the principle of **least privilege**:
- Users only receive access required for their role.
- Admin access is limited and audited.


Data Standards & Best Practices
===============================

- Enter data once, correctly.
- Do not bypass required fields.
- Keep naming conventions consistent.
- Avoid duplicate records.
- Update job statuses promptly.
- Log changes and notes clearly.
- Never rely on memory—document everything.

Systems are only as good as the data entered into them.


Security & Credentials
======================

- Never share passwords or login credentials.
- Use strong, unique passwords.
- Enable two-factor authentication where available.
- Lock computers when unattended.
- Report suspicious activity immediately.
- Do not store credentials in plain text.

System access is revoked immediately when staff leave the company.


Hardware & Devices
==================

This chapter may also include SOPs for:

- Company laptops and tablets  
- Barcode scanners  
- Network equipment  
- Printers and labelers  
- Backup drives  

Devices must be maintained, updated, and tracked as company assets.


Change Management
=================

Any changes to core systems must follow a controlled process:

1. Identify the need for change.
2. Evaluate impact on workflows.
3. Test changes in a controlled environment if possible.
4. Communicate changes to affected users.
5. Update SOPs and documentation.
6. Train users as needed.

Unannounced system changes are not permitted.


Disaster Recovery & Continuity
==============================

- Critical data must be backed up regularly.
- Cloud systems must be monitored for availability.
- Offline access procedures should exist where possible.
- Key documents (contracts, insurance, SOPs) must be accessible even during outages.

Continuity planning reduces downtime during emergencies.

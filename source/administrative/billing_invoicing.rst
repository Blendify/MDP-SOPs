Billing Workflow Overview
=========================

Billing follows a standardized lifecycle:

1. **Job Review & Closeout**
2. **Invoice Creation**
3. **Internal Review**
4. **Invoice Delivery**
5. **Payment Tracking**
6. **Closeout & Reconciliation**

No invoice may be sent until all required steps are complete.


1. Job Review & Closeout
========================

Before invoicing:

- Confirm the job status is complete or billable.
- Review job scope against what was delivered:
  - Equipment  
  - Labor hours  
  - Overtime  
  - Travel  
  - Consumables  
  - Damage or replacement charges  
- Verify approved change orders are documented.
- Confirm client billing terms.

Outstanding questions must be resolved before proceeding.


2. Invoice Creation (QuickBooks)
================================

Create the invoice in **QuickBooks** using the following standards:

Invoice Requirements
--------------------

Each invoice must include:

- Event name and date(s)
- Clear line-item descriptions
- Quantity, rate, and totals
- Subtotal, tax (if applicable), and total due
- Payment terms and due date
- MP or RV branding as appropriate

Do not combine unrelated jobs on a single invoice.


Line Item Standards
-------------------

- Equipment rentals should be grouped logically.
- Labor should be broken out by role and date range.
- Overtime must be clearly identified.

Clarity reduces disputes.


3. Internal Review
==================

Before sending:

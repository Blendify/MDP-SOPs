Document Management
*******************

This SOP defines how Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV) create, store, organize,
scan, and retain administrative and job-related documents. Consistent document management ensures
information is easy to find, secure, and reliable, and supports legal, financial, and operational
requirements.

If a document cannot be found quickly, it is considered unmanaged.


Purpose
=======

- Standardize how documents are created and stored.
- Ensure documents are easy to locate and understand.
- Protect sensitive and confidential information.
- Support compliance with billing, payroll, and record retention requirements.
- Reduce errors caused by missing or outdated documents.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Administrative and office staff  
- Project Managers  
- Warehouse managers submitting documentation  
- Sales & Client Experience staff  
- Leadership reviewing records  

Anyone creating, handling, or storing documents must follow this SOP.


Document Types Covered
======================

This SOP applies to both **digital and physical documents**, including:

- Job folders and job closeout documents
- Contracts, proposals, and change orders
- Invoices, receipts, and billing support
- Timesheets and payroll documentation
- Vendor and subrental paperwork
- Insurance certificates and legal forms
- Damage reports and repair documentation
- Policies, SOPs, and internal records


Primary Storage Systems
=======================

**Google Workspace**
   Primary storage for active and archived documents.

**QuickBooks**
   System of record for invoices, payments, and financial attachments.

**Current RMS (MP)**
   Source for job references and job-level attachments.

**Flex (RV)**
   Source for rental-related documentation.

**Physical Files**
   Used only when required; must be scanned and digitized promptly.


Document Lifecycle Overview
===========================

All documents follow the same lifecycle:

1. **Creation or Receipt**
2. **Naming & Classification**
3. **Storage**
4. **Use & Updates**
5. **Retention**
6. **Archival or Disposal**

Skipping steps creates risk.


File Naming Standards
=====================

All digital files must use consistent, descriptive naming:

**Format:** ``YYYY-MM-DD_Client_Event_DocumentType_Description``


**Examples:**
- `2025-04-12_AcmeCorp_SpringGala_Invoice_Final.pdf`
- `2025-06-01_FestivalX_LightingChangeOrder_v2.pdf`
- `2025-05-20_Internal_PayrollTimesheet_Week21.xlsx`

Avoid vague names like `scan.pdf` or `final_final.pdf`.


Folder Structure
================

Job folders must follow the standard structure:

- `01_Contracts`
- `02_Quotes_Proposals`
- `03_Change_Orders`
- `04_Invoices_Payments`
- `05_Timesheets_Payroll`
- `06_Vendor_Subrentals`
- `07_Insurance_Legal`
- `08_Damage_Reports`
- `09_Job_Closeout`

Do not create custom folder structures without approval.


Document Scanning
=================

Physical documents must be scanned promptly.

Scanning Standards
------------------

- Scan within 48 hours of receipt.
- Ensure scans are:
  - Legible  
  - Complete  
  - Properly oriented  
- Combine multi-page documents into a single file.
- Use PDF format unless otherwise required.

After scanning, physical documents must be stored or disposed of according to retention rules.


Version Control
===============

- Do not overwrite original documents.
- Use versioning for revisions:
  - `_v1`, `_v2`, `_final`
- Clearly identify superseded versions.
- Only one document should be marked **Final**.

Unclear versioning causes errors.


Access & Permissions
====================

- Grant access on a need-to-know basis.
- Restrict HR, payroll, and financial documents.
- Do not share documents externally without approval.
- Revoke access when roles change.

Confidentiality must be maintained.


Document Updates & Corrections
==============================

- Corrections must be documented.
- Do not alter signed contracts or invoices.
- Add amendments or corrected versions instead.
- Maintain audit trails for changes.

Never modify records to hide errors.


Archival & Retention
====================

- Follow the Record Retention Policy.
- Archive completed job folders after closeout.
- Do not delete records prematurely.
- Legal holds override retention schedules.

Retention protects the company.

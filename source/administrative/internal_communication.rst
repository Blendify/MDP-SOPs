Internal Communication Standards
********************************

This SOP defines the standards and expectations for internal communication at Maryland Productions
(MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Clear, professional, and timely communication is critical to safety,
efficiency, and successful event execution across departments.

Internal communication includes all written and verbal exchanges between staff, freelancers, and
leadership related to company operations.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure information is communicated clearly, accurately, and consistently.
- Reduce errors caused by miscommunication or missing context.
- Establish expectations for tone, responsiveness, and documentation.
- Define appropriate communication channels for different needs.
- Support collaboration across administrative, warehouse, and technical teams.


Who This SOP Is For
===================

- Administrative and office staff  
- Project Managers and department leads  
- Warehouse managers and technicians  
- Sales & Client Experience staff  
- Freelancers and contractors  
- Leadership  

Anyone communicating internally on behalf of MP or RV must follow this SOP.


Communication Principles
========================

All internal communication should be:

- **Clear** – Say exactly what is needed, with no ambiguity.
- **Professional** – Tone reflects MP/RV standards at all times.
- **Timely** – Information is shared early enough to act on.
- **Documented** – Important decisions and changes are written down.
- **Relevant** – Share information with those who need it, and no more.

If it affects the job, it must be communicated.


Approved Communication Channels
===============================

Different tools serve different purposes. Use the correct channel.


Email
-----

Use email for:

- Formal communication
- Job confirmations and summaries
- Billing, contracts, and legal documentation
- Policy or SOP updates
- Communication requiring an audit trail

Email expectations:
- Use clear subject lines.
- Include job name or reference when applicable.
- Avoid unnecessary reply-all.
- Respond within one business day when possible.


Slack / Internal Messaging
--------------------------

Use Slack or internal messaging for:

- Day-to-day coordination
- Quick questions and clarifications
- Schedule updates
- Non-formal communication

Slack expectations:
- Keep messages concise.
- Use appropriate channels.
- Avoid long decision-making threads—summarize outcomes elsewhere.
- Do not use for sensitive HR or financial information.


Phone / Voice Calls
-------------------

Use phone calls for:

- Urgent issues
- Safety concerns
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Situations requiring immediate clarification

After critical calls:
- Summarize decisions or actions in writing (email or Slack).


In-Person Communication
-----------------------

- Use in-person communication when practical.
- Follow up important instructions or changes in writing.
- Do not rely solely on verbal communication for critical details.


What Must Be Documented
=======================

The following must always be documented in writing:

- Schedule changes
- Scope changes
- Budget or pricing approvals
- Safety decisions or incidents
- Client directives that affect execution
- Equipment substitutions or shortages
- Policy or SOP exceptions

If it is not documented, it is not official.


Tone & Professionalism
======================

All internal communication must:

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Avoid sarcasm, insults, or aggressive language.
- Focus on solutions, not blame.
- Remain calm, especially under pressure.

Unprofessional communication undermines trust and efficiency.


Escalation Guidelines
=====================

Escalate issues when:

- Safety is at risk
- A decision exceeds your authority
- Conflicts cannot be resolved
- Deadlines or budgets are at risk
- Client satisfaction may be impacted

Escalation should be:
- Timely
- Factual
- Solution-oriented

Delaying escalation often worsens problems.


Response Expectations
=====================

- Urgent messages should be acknowledged as soon as possible.
- Non-urgent messages should be responded to within one business day.
- If you cannot resolve an issue immediately, acknowledge receipt and provide a timeline.

Silence is not an acceptable response.


Job-Related Communication Standards
===================================

- Use job names or references consistently.
- Avoid vague phrases like “that gig” or “the show.”
- Confirm receipt of critical instructions.
- Verify understanding when instructions are complex.

Clarity prevents mistakes.


Cross-Department Communication
==============================

- Respect departmental workflows and constraints.
- Share information early when it affects another department.
- Avoid last-minute requests whenever possible.
- Keep PMs informed of issues affecting scope, schedule, or budget.

Collaboration requires awareness beyond your role.


Confidentiality
===============

- Follow Client Confidentiality and Data Security policies.
- Do not share sensitive information in public or unsecured channels.
- Verify recipients before sending confidential details.

Internal communication is still subject to confidentiality rules.

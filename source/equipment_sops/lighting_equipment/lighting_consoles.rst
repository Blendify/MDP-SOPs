Lighting Consoles
*****************

This SOP defines the procedures for handling, preparing, deploying, resetting, and maintaining
**lighting consoles and control surfaces** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution
(RV). Lighting consoles are mission-critical control assets and must be treated with heightened care,
security, and consistency.

This SOP focuses on the **physical console equipment** and its readiness. Technical standards for
show files, networking, and programming practices are covered in the Lighting *Technical* SOPs.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure lighting consoles are reliable, protected, and show-ready.
- Prevent failures caused by improper handling, power issues, or missing accessories.
- Standardize console prep, transport, and reset procedures.
- Protect show files, configuration data, and hardware integrity.
- Reduce risk during load-in, show operation, and strike.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Lighting consoles (MA, Onyx, Chamsys, ETC, etc.)
- Control surfaces and wings
- Playback controllers
- Touchscreens and external monitors
- Keyboards, mice, and accessories
- Console racks and cases


Console Standards
=================

Approved Use
------------

- Consoles may only be operated by trained personnel.
- Consoles must be used for their intended purpose only.
- Unauthorized software, plugins, or configuration changes are prohibited.
- Consoles must remain under crew supervision at all times on-site.

Consoles are high-value and high-risk assets.


Prep Procedure
==============

1. Physical Inspection
----------------------

Before power-up:

- Inspect console body for cracks or damage.
- Verify faders, encoders, buttons, and screens are intact.
- Check ports for bent pins or damage.
- Inspect power supplies and connectors.
- Verify case hardware and foam are intact.

Any physical damage must be addressed before deployment.


2. Power & Boot Verification
----------------------------

- Connect console to appropriate power source.
- Use power conditioning where available.
- Power on and verify:
  - Normal boot sequence  
  - No error messages  
  - Screens and LEDs function  

Unstable power must be resolved before continuing.


3. Peripheral & Output Check
----------------------------

Verify all required peripherals are present and functional:

- External monitors
- Touchscreens
- Keyboard and mouse
- USB ports
- Network ports
- DMX outputs (if applicable)

Missing or faulty peripherals must be replaced before packing.


4. Configuration Verification
-----------------------------

- Confirm correct system settings:
  - Date and time  
  - Network configuration (if required)  
  - Output enablement  
- Confirm required software version.
- Verify fixture libraries are current (if required for the job).

Do not update software without approval.


5. Show File Verification
-------------------------

- Load the correct show file.
- Confirm patch and output.
- Perform a brief output test using:
  - Node  
  - DMX tester  
- Save a verified backup to:
  - Console  
  - External USB  

Show file standards are covered in the Lighting Technical SOP.


6. Packing for Transport
------------------------

- Power down the console completely.
- Disconnect and secure all cables.
- Protect screens and controls.
- Store accessories in designated compartments.
- Ensure no loose items are inside the case.
- Close and latch all case hardware.
- Apply job label and seal.

Never pack a console while powered on.


On-Site Handling & Operation
============================

- Place consoles on stable surfaces only.
- Secure consoles to prevent tipping.
- Keep liquids away at all times.
- Protect consoles from dust, rain, and impact.
- Use clean power whenever possible.
- Maintain clear airflow around vents.

Console issues must be reported immediately.


Strike & Return
===============

- Save the final show file.
- Create backups before shutdown.
- Power down properly.
- Disconnect peripherals carefully.
- Inspect for damage or missing accessories.
- Pack console according to case layout.

Never rush console strike.


Reset & Maintenance
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open the case and inspect all components.
- Clean screens and surfaces.
- Test:
  - Faders  
  - Encoders  
  - Buttons  
  - Screens  
- Verify ports and power supplies.
- Confirm accessories are complete.
- Recharge internal batteries if applicable.

Consoles are not shelf-ready until reset is complete.


Repair Intake
=============

Route consoles to repair if:

- Faders or encoders malfunction
- Screens flicker or fail
- Ports are damaged
- Boot errors occur
- Power is unstable
- Internal batteries fail

Tag consoles **Do Not Use** and document symptoms clearly.


Storage Standards
=================

- Store consoles in climate-controlled areas.
- Keep cases closed when not in use.
- Avoid stacking heavy cases on top.
- Maintain clear labeling and barcodes.

Consoles must remain protected even when idle.


Responsibilities

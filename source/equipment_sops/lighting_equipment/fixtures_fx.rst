Hazers & Special Effects Machines
*********************************

This SOP defines the procedures for handling, preparing, deploying, resetting, and maintaining
**haze machines, fog machines, and special effects (FX) equipment** used by Maryland Productions
(MP) and Event Revolution (RV). These machines directly impact air quality, visibility, safety, and
venue compliance, and must be managed carefully.

This SOP applies to all atmospheric and FX machines used to enhance lighting and visual effects.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure hazers and FX machines operate safely and reliably.
- Prevent damage caused by improper fluid use, storage, or transport.
- Reduce on-site failures and false fire alarm incidents.
- Standardize prep, operation, and reset procedures.
- Protect equipment longevity and venue relationships.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Oil-based hazers
- Water-based hazers
- Fog machines
- Low-lying fog machines
- CO2-based FX devices (where applicable)
- Fans and dispersion accessories
- Remote controls, DMX interfaces, and timers

This SOP does **not** cover pyrotechnics or flame effects.


Equipment Standards
===================

Approved Fluids
---------------

- Use **manufacturer-approved fluid only**.
- Never mix fluid types.
- Never substitute generic or unknown fluids.
- Store fluids in original containers with labels intact.

Using incorrect fluid can permanently damage machines.


Labeling Requirements
=====================

Each machine must be labeled with:

- Asset tag (MP or RV)
- Fluid type required (Oil / Water)
- Power requirements
- DMX capability (Yes/No)

Fluid containers must be labeled with:
- Fluid type
- Date opened (if applicable)

Mislabeling is a critical safety risk.


Prep Procedure
==============

1. Visual Inspection
--------------------

Before applying power:

- Inspect housing for cracks or damage.
- Verify fans and vents are unobstructed.
- Inspect power and DMX connectors.
- Confirm fluid lines and caps are secure.
- Check for leaks or residue.

Machines with leaks must be routed to repair.


2. Fluid Verification
---------------------

- Confirm correct fluid type for the machine.
- Verify fluid level is sufficient for the job.
- Inspect fluid for contamination or discoloration.
- Secure fluid containers for transport.

Never transport machines with loose fluid caps.


3. Power & Control Setup
------------------------

- Verify voltage compatibility.
- Connect to appropriate power source.
- Configure control method:
  - DMX
  - Timer
  - Manual
  - Remote
- Set DMX address if applicable.
- Disable wireless or unused control modes.

Confirm machine responds correctly before packing.


4. Functional Testing
---------------------

Test the machine using:

- Short burst output
- Continuous output (if applicable)
- Fan operation
- DMX or remote control

Check for:
- Even output
- Unusual noise
- Burning smell
- Fluid spitting or pooling

Any abnormal behavior must be documented.


5. Case Packing
---------------

- Ensure machines are cool before packing.
- Drain fluid only if required by manufacturer.
- Secure machines upright in cases.
- Protect fluid containers from tipping.
- Pack remotes, cables, and accessories in designated compartments.
- Label cases with:
  - Machine type
  - Fluid type
  - Orientation warnings

Never pack hazers sideways unless designed for it.


On-Site Operation
=================

Venue & Safety Considerations
-----------------------------

Before operation:

- Confirm haze/fog is approved by the venue.
- Verify fire alarm and smoke detector policies.
- Inform PM and venue staff before activation.
- Ensure adequate ventilation.

Never activate hazers without venue approval.


Operation Guidelines
--------------------

- Start with minimal output.
- Increase gradually as needed.
- Avoid direct output toward:
  - Performers’ faces
  - Audience seating
  - Fire detectors
- Monitor air quality continuously.
- Do not run machines dry.

Shut down immediately if alarms are triggered.


Strike & Return
===============

- Power down machines and allow to cool.
- Secure fluid caps.
- Inspect for leaks.
- Wipe exterior surfaces.
- Pack machines upright.
- Report any issues or incidents.


Reset & Maintenance
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open cases and inspect machines.
- Check for leaks or residue.
- Clean exterior surfaces.
- Run machine briefly to clear lines if required.
- Drain or flush fluid per manufacturer guidance (scheduled).
- Inspect fans, heaters, and pumps.

Machines are not shelf-ready until reset is complete.


Repair Intake
=============

Route machines to repair if:

- Output is weak or inconsistent
- Pump does not prime
- Fans fail to operate
- Excessive noise occurs
- Fluid leaks are present
- Error codes appear

Tag machines **Do Not Use** and document symptoms.


Storage Standards
=================

- Store machines upright.
- Store fluids separately in designated areas.
- Keep away from extreme heat or cold.
- Prevent fluid contamination.
- Keep machines clean and dry.

Improper storage shortens equipment lifespan.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Perform prep and reset procedures.
- Verify correct fluid usage.
- Pack and store machines properly.

Technicians
-----------

- Operate machines safely on-site.
- Follow venue rules.
- Monitor output and air quality.
- Report issues immediately.

Project Managers
----------------

- Confirm haze approval with venues.
- Communicate restrictions to crew.
- Document incidents involving alarms or complaints.


Quality Control
===============

- Only approved fluids may be used.
- Machines must be tested before deployment.
- No leaking machines may be shelved.
- Labels must be accurate and legible.
- Venue approval must be confirmed.

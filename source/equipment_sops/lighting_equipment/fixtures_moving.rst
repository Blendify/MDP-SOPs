Moving Light Fixtures
*********************

This SOP defines the procedures for handling, preparing, deploying, resetting, and maintaining
**moving light fixtures** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Moving lights
are complex electromechanical devices and require disciplined handling to ensure reliability,
safety, and longevity.

This SOP applies to all automated fixtures including spots, washes, beams, profiles, and hybrids.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all moving lights leave the warehouse fully functional and correctly configured.
- Reduce on-site failures through standardized prep and testing.
- Prevent damage caused by improper handling or packing.
- Establish clear reset and maintenance expectations after every show.
- Maintain consistent quality across all MP/RV productions.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Warehouse prep and testing
- Case packing and transport
- On-site handling and operation
- Return, reset, and maintenance
- Repair intake and documentation


Required Tools & Materials
==========================

- Appropriate power source (Edison, PowerCON, True1)
- DMX console or tester
- Network node (if applicable)
- Cleaning supplies (lens wipes, compressed air, microfiber)
- Label printer or labels
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)


Prep Procedure
==============

1. Visual Inspection
--------------------

Before applying power:

- Inspect housing for cracks, dents, or missing fasteners.
- Check yoke arms and tilt locks.
- Inspect clamps for:
  - Correct type
  - Cracks or deformation
- Verify safety cable is:
  - Correct rating
  - Free of fraying or damage
- Inspect power and data connectors.

Fixtures failing inspection must be routed to repair.


2. Power-Up & Mode Configuration
--------------------------------

1. Connect fixture to the correct power type.
2. Power on and allow full boot cycle.
3. Set the DMX mode per the advance or show file.
4. Disable:
   - Auto programs
   - Sound-active modes
   - Wireless DMX (unless required)
5. Verify fan mode and cooling settings.

Mode mismatches are a leading cause of failures.


3. Addressing & Labeling
------------------------

- Set the starting DMX address.
- Verify universe assignment.
- Label the fixture with:
  - Universe
  - Starting address
  - Mode (if ambiguous)

Labels must be visible when the fixture is hung.


4. Functional Testing
---------------------

Each fixture must pass a full test:

- Pan and tilt (full range)
- Color wheel or color mixing
- Zoom and focus
- Gobos and prisms (if applicable)
- Shutter and strobe
- Dimming curve
- Display and menu buttons

Test using a console or tester—not auto modes.

Any abnormal behavior must be documented.


5. Cleaning
-----------

- Clean lenses with approved wipes.
- Blow dust from fans and vents.
- Wipe exterior surfaces.
- Remove old tape or labels.

Never use solvents or abrasive materials.


6. Accessory Verification
-------------------------

Confirm each fixture includes:

- Correct clamp(s)
- Safety cable
- Power jumper
- Required adapters

Missing accessories must be replaced before packing.


Case Packing & Transport
========================

- Place fixtures into correct foam orientation.
- Lock pan and tilt if required by manufacturer.
- Protect lenses where applicable.
- Store clamps and safeties in designated compartments.
- Do not force lids closed.
- Latch all case hardware securely.
- Apply job label to the case.

Fixtures must never shift inside the case.


On-Site Handling
================

- Team-lift heavy fixtures.
- Never lift by head or yoke alone.
- Hang fixtures only after clamps and safeties are verified.
- Do not power fixtures until secured.
- Avoid dragging fixtures across surfaces.
- Protect fixtures from rain, dust, and impact.

Improper handling is a primary cause of fixture damage.


Strike & Return
===============

- Power down fixtures before unplugging.
- Allow fixtures to cool before packing.
- Return fixtures to neutral or home position.
- Inspect for visible damage.
- Pack fixtures according to case layout.
- Report issues immediately to the crew lead or PM.


Reset & Maintenance
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open cases and remove fixtures.
- Clean lenses, fans, and exterior.
- Perform a full functional test.
- Identify issues requiring repair.
- Update firmware if scheduled.
- Document:
  - Failures
  - Error codes
  - Unusual behavior

Fixtures are not shelf-ready until reset is complete.


Repair Intake
=============

Route fixtures to repair if:

- Pan/tilt drifts or stalls
- Color or gobo wheels fail
- Fans are excessively loud
- Error codes persist
- Power or data connectors are damaged

Tag fixtures clearly and document issues.


Quality Control
===============

- Every moving light must be powered and tested.
- No fixture leaves without correct mode and address.
- Cases must be packed correctly every time.
- Accessories must be complete.
- Reset must occur before shelving.

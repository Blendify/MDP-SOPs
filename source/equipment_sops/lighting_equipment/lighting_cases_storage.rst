Lighting Cases & Storage
************************

This SOP defines the standards and procedures for storing, packing, labeling, and maintaining
**lighting road cases and storage solutions** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution
(RV). Proper case management protects equipment, speeds up warehouse workflows, and reduces damage
during transport.

This SOP applies to all cases, racks, trunks, and storage systems used for lighting equipment and
accessories.


Purpose
=======

- Protect lighting equipment during storage and transport.
- Standardize case packing and labeling.
- Prevent damage caused by improper storage or overpacking.
- Improve warehouse efficiency and load-in/load-out speed.
- Ensure accurate tracking of case contents.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Fixture cases (moving and static)
- Console and control cases
- Cable trunks
- Accessory and clamp cases
- Power and data distribution cases
- Custom foam and specialty cases


Case Standards
==============

Approved Case Types
-------------------

- ATA-rated road cases
- Shock-mounted racks
- Custom foam-insert cases
- Trunks with dividers or bins

Cases must be:
- Structurally sound
- Properly latched
- Free of exposed sharp edges
- Rated for the weight of contents


Case Labeling
=============

All cases must be labeled with:

- Case name or type
- Contents description
- Quantity (where applicable)
- Ownership prefix (MP or RV)
- Barcode for scanning

Additional labels may include:
- Weight warnings

Labels must be legible and maintained.


Packing Standards
=================

General Rules
-------------

- Never force a case closed.

Accessory & Clamp Cases
-----------------------

- Clamps sorted by type and size.
- Safeties stored separately from clamps when possible.

Cable Trunks
------------

- Cables coiled properly by length and type.

Sealing & Job Assignment
========================

When cases are staged for a job:

1. Verify contents against the pull sheet.
2. Close and latch the case.
3. Apply a **case seal** (e.g., blue painter’s tape) indicating:
   - Job name  
   - Date  
   - Initials of the staff member  
4. Scan the case out to the job in the system.

Sealed cases indicate verified contents.


Storage Standards
=================

Warehouse Placement
-------------------

- Heaviest cases on the bottom.
- Do not block aisles, exits, or fire equipment.
- Keep cases accessible without excessive stacking.

Environmental Conditions

Outdoor-rated cases must still be stored indoors when possible.


Returns & Check-In
==================

Upon return from a job:

- Open all cases.
- Scan all internal contents back into the system.
- Verify quantities and condition.
- Remove job seal after verification.
- Route damaged cases or contents to repair.

Cases may not be re-sealed or shelved until contents are verified.


Case Maintenance
================

- Inspect cases regularly for:
  - Broken latches  
  - Worn casters

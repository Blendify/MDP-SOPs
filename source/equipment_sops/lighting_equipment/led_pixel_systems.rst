LED & Pixel Lighting Systems
****************************

This SOP defines the procedures for handling, preparing, deploying, resetting, and maintaining
**LED and pixel-based lighting systems** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).
These systems include fixtures and elements with individually addressable pixels or segments and
often involve higher channel counts, networked control, and complex configuration.

Because pixel systems are more sensitive to configuration, power quality, and data integrity, they
require stricter prep, labeling, and documentation standards than conventional fixtures.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure pixel systems are configured correctly before leaving the warehouse.
- Prevent addressing, mapping, and power issues on-site.
- Maintain visual consistency across tiles, bars, and pixel elements.
- Reduce troubleshooting time during load-in and rehearsals.
- Protect delicate connectors and electronics during transport.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- LED pixel bars and battens
- Pixel tape systems and controllers
- LED panels used as lighting (non-video walls)
- Pixel drivers and decoders
- Associated power and data cabling


Required Tools & Materials
==========================

- Appropriate power sources (Edison, PowerCON, True1, low-voltage PSU)
- Lighting console with pixel control capability
- Network node or pixel controller
- DMX tester or pixel test pattern generator
- Cleaning supplies (microfiber cloths)
- Label printer or labels
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)


Prep Procedure
==============

1. Visual Inspection
--------------------

Before applying power:

- Inspect housings for cracks or bent frames.
- Check all data and power connectors for damage.
- Verify locking connectors engage fully.
- Inspect cables for cuts, kinks, or exposed conductors.
- Confirm mounting hardware is present and secure.

Damaged pixel elements must be removed from service immediately.


2. Power Configuration
----------------------

1. Verify required voltage and current for each component.
2. Confirm correct PSU or distro is assigned.
3. Check polarity on low-voltage systems.
4. Label power supplies with:
   - Output voltage  
   - Intended pixel elements  

Undervoltage and reversed polarity are common causes of pixel failure.


3. Mode Selection & Pixel Mapping
---------------------------------

1. Set fixture or controller mode according to the advance.
2. Verify:
   - Pixel count  
   - Pixel order (RGB / RGBW)  
   - Segment grouping  
   - Orientation (start/end direction)  
3. Confirm console profile matches the physical configuration.
4. Disable auto patterns or internal effects.

Mapping mismatches will cause visual artifacts—verify carefully.


4. Addressing & Universe Assignment
-----------------------------------

- Assign starting addresses sequentially.
- Confirm channel count per element.
- Avoid mixing pixel systems with conventional fixtures on the same universe unless planned.
- Document:
  - Universe numbers  
  - Address ranges  
  - Physical locations  

Label each element or group clearly.


5. Functional Testing
---------------------

Test each system using test patterns:

- Solid colors (R, G, B, W)
- Chases
- Gradients
- Full-intensity white

Check for:
- Dead pixels
- Color mismatch
- Flicker or instability
- Incorrect orientation or order

Any anomalies must be resolved before packing.


6. Cleaning
-----------

- Wipe lenses or diffusers with microfiber cloths.
- Remove fingerprints and residue.
- Avoid liquids near connectors.
- Ensure connectors are dry and clean.


Case Packing & Transport
========================

- Pack pixel elements in foam or padded cases.
- Protect connectors with caps or covers.
- Coil pixel cables loosely—do not tightly bend.
- Store controllers and PSUs in designated compartments.
- Label cases clearly with system contents and orientation notes.

Pixel systems must not shift during transport.


On-Site Handling
================

- Power systems only after confirming configuration.
- Verify polarity before connecting low-voltage lines.
- Secure pixel elements before applying power.
- Avoid stepping on or pinching pixel cables.
- Keep pixel elements dry and protected from impact.

Never hot-plug low-voltage pixel connections unless rated.


Strike & Return
===============

- Power down systems before disconnecting.
- Allow components to cool if applicable.
- Inspect connectors for damage.
- Coil cables properly.
- Pack elements according to case layout.
- Report failures or anomalies immediately.


Reset & Maintenance
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open cases and inspect all components.
- Clean diffusers and housings.
- Re-test pixel output.
- Identify dead or dim pixels.
- Verify controller firmware if scheduled.
- Document recurring issues or failures.

Pixel systems are not shelf-ready until reset is complete.


Repair Intake
=============

Route pixel equipment to repair if:

- Pixels fail or display incorrect colors
- Controllers lose configuration
- Power supplies overheat or shut down
- Connectors are loose or damaged
- Flicker persists after reconfiguration

Tag items clearly and document symptoms.


Quality Control
===============

- All pixel systems must be fully tested with patterns.
- Configuration must match documentation exactly.
- Labels must be clear and accurate.
- Cables and connectors must be protected.
- Reset must occur before shelving.

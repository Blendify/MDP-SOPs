Lighting Reset & Maintenance
****************************

The Lighting Reset & Maintenance SOP defines the procedures required to restore all lighting
equipment to a clean, functional, and show-ready state after returning from a job. Proper reset and
maintenance reduce on-site failures, extend equipment lifespan, and ensure accurate inventory
status for future bookings.

No lighting equipment may be returned to storage or made available for rental until it has
completed the full reset process.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all lighting equipment is returned to a known, reliable state.
- Identify and address damage or failures immediately after use.
- Maintain consistent quality and performance across the inventory.
- Support accurate repair tracking and preventative maintenance.
- Reduce prep time and surprises on future jobs.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Moving light fixtures
- Static lighting fixtures
- LED and pixel systems
- Lighting consoles and control devices
- Lighting power and data accessories
- Lighting cases and foam inserts


Reset Workflow Overview
=======================

Lighting reset occurs in five phases:

1. **Initial Check-In**
2. **Cleaning**
3. **Functional Testing**
4. **Repair Intake & Maintenance**
5. **Final Verification & Shelving**

Each phase must be completed in order.


1. Initial Check-In
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open all lighting cases.
- Remove fixtures and accessories.
- Verify all internal case contents were scanned in correctly.
- Compare contents to:
  - Case labels  
  - Pull sheet  
  - Return notes  

Identify:
- Missing items
- Visible damage
- Loose hardware
- Bent clamps or safeties

Document issues immediately before proceeding.


2. Cleaning
===========

Fixtures
--------

- Clean lenses with approved lens wipes.
- Blow dust from fans, vents, and grills.
- Wipe exterior surfaces with microfiber cloths.
- Remove tape residue and show labels.

LED & Pixel Systems
-------------------

- Clean diffusers and lenses carefully.
- Inspect connectors for debris.
- Ensure connectors are fully dry.

Cases & Accessories
-------------------

- Vacuum or wipe foam inserts.
- Remove debris from cases.
- Clean clamps, safeties, and brackets.

Never use abrasive materials or solvents unless manufacturer-approved.


3. Functional Testing
=====================

All lighting equipment must be powered and tested.

Moving Lights
-------------

- Full pan/tilt test
- Color mixing and wheels
- Zoom and focus
- Gobos and prisms
- Shutter and dimming
- Menu navigation and display

Static Fixtures
---------------

- Output consistency
- Color accuracy
- Dimming response
- Fan noise (if applicable)

LED & Pixel Systems
-------------------

- Solid color tests (RGB/W)
- Chase and gradient tests
- Pixel orientation and order
- Check for dead or dim pixels

Control Devices
---------------

- Power-up and boot verification
- Output test (DMX/network)
- Button, encoder, and fader checks

Any abnormal behavior must be documented.


4. Repair Intake & Maintenance
==============================

Route equipment to repair if any of the following are observed:

- Error codes or boot failures
- Mechanical binding or drift
- Flickering or unstable output
- Dead pixels or color mismatch
- Excessive fan noise or overheating
- Damaged connectors or cables

Repair Intake Procedure
-----------------------

1. Tag the item **Do Not Use**.
2. Create a repair record with:
   - Asset ID  
   - Description of issue  
   - When the issue occurred  
3. Place item in designated repair area.
4. Notify repair technician or manager.

Preventative Maintenance
------------------------

When scheduled or required:
- Update fixture firmware.
- Tighten loose hardware.
- Replace worn clamps or safeties.
- Replace lamps where applicable.
- Update internal configuration defaults.

Preventative maintenance must be logged.


5. Final Verification & Shelving
================================

Before shelving:

- Confirm item passed functional testing.
- Verify correct accessories are included.
- Reset addresses and modes to default if required.
- Remove old job-specific labels.
- Pack item correctly into its case.
- Confirm case contents match label.

Only after verification may equipment be marked **Available** and returned to storage.


Documentation Requirements
==========================

All reset and maintenance activity must be documented:

- Repair actions taken
- Parts replaced
- Firmware updates performed
- Repeated or recurring issues
- Items removed from service

Documentation must be entered into:
- Flex (RV)
- Current RMS (MP)
- Internal maintenance logs (if applicable)


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
---------------

- Perform cleaning and initial testing.
- Identify and document issues.
- Pack and shelve only verified equipment.

Repair Technicians
------------------

- Diagnose and repair failed equipment.
- Perform preventative maintenance.
- Update firmware and configurations.
- Close repair records when complete.

Project Managers
----------------

- Review damage or loss reports.
- Approve replacements or write-offs when required.
- Communicate equipment issues affecting future jobs.


Quality Control
===============

- No lighting equipment may be shelved without testing.
- Repair items must be clearly tagged.
- Documentation must be complete and accurate.
- Repeated failures must be escalated for review.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**High volume returns**
- Prioritize safety-critical and high-demand fixtures first.

**Minor cosmetic damage**
- Document and monitor; repair if it worsens.

**Recurring failures**
- Escalate for deeper inspection or retirement.

**Rush turnaround**
- Reset must still be completed—do not skip testing.

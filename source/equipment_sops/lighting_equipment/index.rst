Lighting Equipment
******************

The Lighting Equipment section documents the standardized procedures for handling, preparing,
deploying, maintaining, and storing all lighting-related equipment owned or managed by Maryland
Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV).

This section focuses on the **physical equipment itself**—fixtures, consoles, control devices,
power, and accessories—and how they move through the warehouse, onto shows, and back into inventory.
It complements the Lighting *Technical* SOPs, which define system design and control standards.


Purpose
=======

- Define consistent handling and care standards for all lighting equipment.
- Ensure fixtures and accessories remain show-ready and reliable.
- Reduce equipment failures through proper prep and reset procedures.
- Provide clear guidance for warehouse staff and lighting technicians.
- Support accurate inventory tracking and asset longevity.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Warehouse lighting prep staff  
- Repair technicians  
- Lighting technicians and crew leads  
- Project Managers verifying lighting packages  
- Freelancers working with MP/RV lighting gear  

Anyone physically handling lighting equipment should follow the SOPs in this section.


Scope of Lighting Equipment
===========================

This section covers procedures for the following lighting equipment categories:

Fixtures
--------

- Moving lights (spots, washes, beams, hybrids)
- Static fixtures (pars, ellipsoidals, floods)
- LED bars, battens, and pixel fixtures
- Architectural and effect lighting

Control & Processing
--------------------

- Lighting consoles and control surfaces
- Playback controllers
- DMX testers
- Network nodes and gateways
- DMX splitters and opto-isolators

Power & Distribution
--------------------

- Edison, PowerCON, and True1 cabling
- Lighting distro
- Breakout boxes
- Power jumpers and adapters

Rigging Interfaces
------------------

- Clamps
- Safety cables
- Yokes and brackets
- Mounting hardware specific to lighting fixtures

Storage & Transport
-------------------

- Lighting road cases
- Foam inserts
- Accessory bins
- Fixture-specific transport hardware


Lighting Equipment Lifecycle
============================

All lighting equipment follows the same lifecycle:

1. **Prep**
   - Inspection
   - Cleaning
   - Functional testing
   - Addressing and labeling
   - Accessory verification
   - Case packing

2. **Deployment**
   - Loading onto trucks
   - On-site setup and hanging
   - Focus and operation

3. **Return**
   - Check-in and scanning
   - Verification of internal case contents
   - Damage and loss reporting

4. **Reset & Maintenance**
   - Cleaning after use
   - Re-testing functionality
   - Repair intake if required
   - Firmware updates
   - Return to shelf-ready condition

No lighting equipment may be shelved unless it has completed the full reset process.


Labeling & Tracking Standards
=============================

All lighting equipment must have:

- Asset tag with ownership prefix (MP or RV)
- Barcode for inventory scanning
- Fixture-specific labels:
  - Universe
  - Address
  - Mode (when applicable)

Cases must be labeled with:
- Equipment type
- Quantity
- Job assignment (when staged)

Lighting equipment must be scanned:
- Out to jobs during prep
- Back in during returns
- Into cases where applicable

Unscanned equipment is considered missing.


Responsibilities
================

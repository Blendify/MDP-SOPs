Static Lighting Fixtures
************************

This SOP defines the procedures for handling, preparing, deploying, resetting, and maintaining
**static lighting fixtures** used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV). Static
fixtures include all non-moving luminaires that require manual aiming, focusing, or configuration.

While mechanically simpler than moving lights, static fixtures still require disciplined handling,
testing, and labeling to ensure safety, consistency, and show-ready performance.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure static fixtures are clean, functional, and correctly configured.
- Maintain consistent prep and reset standards across all fixture types.
- Prevent failures caused by damaged cables, lamps, or housings.
- Support safe handling and hanging practices.
- Extend fixture lifespan through proper maintenance.


Scope
=====

This SOP applies to:

- Warehouse prep and testing
- Case packing and transport
- On-site hanging, focusing, and operation
- Return, reset, and maintenance
- Repair intake and documentation


Fixture Types Covered
=====================

Static fixtures include, but are not limited to:

- LED pars and washes
- Ellipsoidals (conventional and LED)
- Fresnels
- Cyc lights
- Blinders
- Architectural fixtures
- Practical and effect fixtures


Required Tools & Materials
==========================

- Appropriate power source (Edison, PowerCON, True1)
- DMX console or tester (for DMX fixtures)
- Cleaning supplies (lens wipes, microfiber cloths)
- Label printer or labels
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)
- Shutters, frames, or accessories as required


Prep Procedure
==============

1. Visual Inspection
--------------------

Before applying power:

- Inspect housing for cracks, dents, or loose hardware.
- Verify yoke and tilt locks operate smoothly.
- Inspect clamps:
  - Correct type
  - No cracks or deformation
- Verify safety cable is present and rated.
- Inspect power and data connectors.
- For conventional fixtures:
  - Check lamp seating and condition.

Any fixture failing inspection must be routed to repair.


2. Power-Up & Configuration
---------------------------

1. Connect fixture to the correct power type.
2. Power on and confirm normal operation.
3. For DMX fixtures:
   - Set DMX mode per the advance.
   - Disable auto or sound-active modes.
4. For conventional fixtures:
   - Verify dimmer compatibility.
   - Confirm lamp type and wattage.

Incorrect configuration is a common source of show issues.


3. Addressing & Labeling
------------------------

For DMX fixtures:

- Set starting address.
- Confirm universe assignment.
- Label fixture with:
  - Universe
  - Address
  - Mode (if applicable)

For non-DMX fixtures:

- Label fixture type and circuit usage if required.

Labels must remain visible when hung.


4. Functional Testing
---------------------

Each fixture must pass a functional test:

- Output consistency
- Color mixing (if applicable)
- Dimmer response
- Shutter operation (ellipsoidals)
- Barn doors or accessory fit
- Fan noise (if applicable)

Test using console or dimmer control—not auto modes.


5. Cleaning
-----------

- Clean lenses and reflectors as appropriate.
- Remove dust from vents and fans.
- Wipe exterior surfaces.
- Remove tape residue or old labels.

Avoid solvents unless manufacturer-approved.


6. Accessory Verification
-------------------------

Confirm fixture includes required accessories:

- Clamp
- Safety cable
- Shutters or barn doors
- Gel frames (if required)
- Power jumpers or adapters

Missing accessories must be replaced before packing.


Case Packing & Transport
========================

- Pack fixtures according to case layout.
- Protect lenses and connectors.
- Store accessories in designated compartments.
- Do not stack fixtures loosely.
- Close and latch cases fully.
- Apply job label to case.

Fixtures must not shift during transport.


On-Site Handling
================

- Team-lift heavier fixtures.
- Never lift by barn doors or shutters.
- Hang fixtures only after clamps and safeties are verified.
- Lock tilt and pan knobs after focus.
- Keep fixtures clear of heat-sensitive materials.
- Protect fixtures from moisture and impact.

Manual fixtures require careful alignment and locking.


Strike & Return
===============

- Power down fixtures before unplugging.
- Allow fixtures to cool before packing.
- Inspect for damage or loose parts.
- Return accessories to proper bins.
- Pack fixtures according to case layout.
- Report issues immediately.


Reset & Maintenance
===================

Upon return to the warehouse:

- Open cases and remove fixtures.
- Clean lenses, housings, and vents.
- Test output and dimming response.
- Replace lamps if required.
- Identify fixtures needing repair.
- Document any failures or issues.

Fixtures are not shelf-ready until reset is complete.


Repair Intake
=============

Route fixtures to repair if:

- Output is uneven or flickering
- Lamps fail repeatedly
- DMX response is erratic
- Connectors are damaged
- Mechanical components are loose or seized

Tag fixtures clearly and document issues.


Quality Control
===============

- Every fixture must be powered and tested.
- Labels must be correct and legible.
- Accessories must be complete.
- Cases must be packed correctly.
- Reset must occur before shelving.

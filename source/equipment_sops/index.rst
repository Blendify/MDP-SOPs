Equipment SOPs Overview
***********************

The Equipment SOPs chapter documents the standardized procedures for handling, preparing,
maintaining, troubleshooting, and storing all equipment used by Maryland Productions (MP) and Event
Revolution (RV). This includes lighting, audio, video, rigging, power, staging, networking,
transportation accessories, and all supporting hardware.

These procedures ensure consistent equipment quality, minimize on-site failures, maintain safety
standards, and extend the lifespan of MP/RV assets. Equipment SOPs define exactly how each type of
gear should be cared for from warehouse receipt to on-site deployment and return.


Purpose
=======

- Provide clear, repeatable procedures for preparing and maintaining equipment.
- Ensure equipment leaves the warehouse and returns in show-ready condition.
- Create consistency across technicians, freelancers, and departments.
- Reduce gear failures through standardized testing and maintenance.
- Support accurate asset tracking in Current RMS and Flex.
- Protect MP/RV investments and maximize asset lifespan.


Who This Section Is For
=======================

- Warehouse staff  
- Repair technicians  
- Lighting, audio, video, and rigging technicians  
- Project Managers verifying equipment prep  
- Logistics staff handling truck loads  
- Freelancers interacting with MP/RV gear  

Anyone touching equipment before, during, or after an event should follow the procedures in this
chapter.

- Camera systems  
- Playback devices  
- Fiber and SDI cable systems  

**Rigging Equipment**
- Chain motors  
- Truss  
- Spansets & steel  
- Shackles and hardware  
- Baseplates & rigging tools  

**Power Equipment**
- Camlock & feeder  
- Distro systems  
- L21-30 / 14-50 / Edison distribution  
- Cable management & safety items  

**Staging & Miscellaneous**
- Pipe & drape  
- Staging decks  
- Soft goods  
- Lifts and carts  
- Consumables (tape, batteries, tie line, etc.)  

**Storage Equipment**
- Road cases  
- Racks  
- Cable trunks  
- Toolboxes & kits  

Each equipment category includes SOPs for prep, operation, and reset.


Equipment Workflow Overview
===========================

Equipment passes through several standardized phases:

1. **Prep**  
   - Cleaning  
   - Testing  
   - Configuration  
   - Labeling  
   - Packing  

2. **Deployment**  
   - Loading onto trucks  
   - On-site setup  
   - Operation during show  

3. **Protection**  
   - Proper handling on-site  
   - Use of cases, covers, and safety practices  
   - Cable management & power safety  

4. **Return & Check-In**  
   - Scanning items back into systems  
   - Verifying internal case contents  
   - Identifying missing or damaged items  

5. **Reset & Maintenance**  
   - Cleaning after use  
   - Testing functionality  
   - Repair intake  
   - Firmware updates  
   - Returning gear to show-ready condition  

Every piece of equipment must fully complete this lifecycle before being shelved.


Equipment Labeling & Tracking Standards
=======================================

All equipment must follow MP/RV labeling standards:

- Asset tag with ownership prefix (MP or RV)  
- Barcode for scanning  
- Universe/channel labels for lighting  
- Length & type labels for cables  
- Direction labels for power/data where applicable  
- Case labels indicating contents and job assignment  

Tracking is handled through:
- **Current RMS (MP)**  
- **Flex (RV)**  

No item leaves the warehouse unless it is scanned out properly.


Equipment Responsibility Breakdown
==================================

Warehouse Staff
   - Prepare and pack equipment  
   - Clean, test, and reset items  
   - Maintain storage organization  
   - Perform initial diagnostics for failures  

Repair Technicians
   - Diagnose and fix broken or malfunctioning gear  
   - Perform scheduled maintenance  
   - Update firmware and internal configurations  

Technicians (Lighting/Audio/Video/Rigging)
   - Use the equipment on-site safely and professionally  
   - Report issues promptly  
   - Follow labeling and connection best practices  

Project Managers
   - Ensure equipment list matches show needs  
   - Communicate equipment changes to warehouse  
   - Review missing/damaged reports after the show  


Structure of Equipment SOPs
===========================

Each equipment category will include individual SOPs with:

- Overview  
- Safety considerations  
- Prep procedure  
- On-site handling  
- Troubleshooting steps  
- Reset & maintenance  
- Storage requirements  
- Photos or diagrams (optional)  

This ensures every SOP is consistent and easy to reference.

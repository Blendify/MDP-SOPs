Prep & Testing
**************

The Prep & Testing workflow ensures that all equipment leaving the warehouse is fully functional,
properly configured, and ready for immediate deployment on-site. This reduces on-site troubleshooting,
minimizes failure rates, and guarantees consistent quality across all MP and RV shows.

Prep & Testing occurs **after Staging** and before **Truck Loading**, once all equipment is pulled,
scanned, and organized.


Purpose
=======

- Verify that all fixtures, audio equipment, video systems, and power distribution gear function properly.
- Load appropriate configurations, firmware, presets, and show files.
- Ensure all cables and accessories are clean, intact, and operational.
- Prevent on-site failures and downtime.
- Standardize testing across departments.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Perform standard electrical, signal, and physical tests on all gear.
   - Verify equipment is clean and show-ready.
   - Flag and remove any gear that fails testing.

Department Leads / Technicians
   - Load or verify show files, configs, or presets when needed.
   - Perform advanced or job-specific prep (e.g., pixel tape maps, timecode setups).

Project Managers
   - Confirm any special prep requirements for the job.
   - Provide show files, patch information, or diagrams as needed.

Repair Technicians
   - Handle failed equipment and restore it to service when possible.
   - Document repairs and return items to inventory.


Required Tools
==============

- Power testing stations
- DMX testers / console
- Audio playback device / signal generator
- RF scanner (for wireless prep)
- Video signal tester or test generator
- Networking hardware (if required)
- Cleaning supplies (alcohol wipes, compressed air, microfiber)
- PPE (gloves, glasses as required)


Procedure
=========

1. Lighting Prep
----------------

1. Inspect fixture housing, yoke, clamps, and safeties.
2. Connect fixtures to power and DMX network.
3. Run basic tests:
   - Pan/tilt  
   - Zoom/focus  
   - Color mixing  
   - Gobos/prisms  
   - Shutter/strobe  
4. Check:
   - PowerCON/True1 in/out condition  
   - DMX ports  
   - Display and buttons  
5. Update firmware if needed.
6. Load show-specific profiles or macros (if provided).
7. Clean lens and exterior surfaces.

*Cables:*  
- Test True1, Edison, and DMX cables for continuity.  
- Recoil to standard length and label orientation.


2. Audio Prep
-------------

1. Test loudspeakers with signal:
   - HF and LF drivers  
   - Amplified vs passive configs  
2. Verify:
   - IEC and power cables  
   - NL4/XLR cables  
3. Test consoles:
   - Boot to correct firmware  
   - Load or confirm show file  
   - Test all inputs/outputs  
4. Prep RF:
   - Scan and assign frequencies  
   - Test transmitters and receivers  
   - Check battery health

*Cables:*  
- Test XLR for continuity and polarity.  
- Label and regroup cables into typed trunks.


3. Video Prep
-------------

1. Test LED tiles individually and in small arrays.
2. Check:
   - Panels for dead pixels  
   - Locking mechanisms  
   - Power and data ports  
3. Test processors:
   - Load correct configuration  
   - Check input/output routing  
4. Validate cameras:
   - Lens cleanliness  
   - SDI/HDMI outputs  
   - Power supplies/batteries  

*Cables:*  
- Test SDI for signal integrity.  
- Ensure HDMI cables are correct versions for their application.


4. Power & Distro Prep
----------------------

1. Inspect all camlock connectors for:
   - Cracked housings  
   - Loose set screws  
   - Bent pins  
2. Test:
   - Distro outputs  
   - Breaker functionality  
   - Phase indicators  
3. Inspect multicables and breakouts.
4. Verify:
   - Neutral and ground continuity  
   - Labels and color coding  
5. Clean and band cables neatly.


5. Rigging Prep
---------------

1. Inspect chain motors for:
   - Kinks, twists, or birdcaging in chain  
   - Cracks in hooks  
   - Proper lubrication  
2. Power motors briefly to ensure proper function.
3. Inspect truss:
   - Dents  
   - Damaged welds  
   - End plates and bolts  
4. Verify spansets, steel, and hardware:
   - Load ratings  
   - Tag condition  
   - No fraying or rust


6. Final Verification
---------------------

1. Re-check all items against the pull sheet.
2. Mark any failed items as “Do Not Use” and send to repair.
3. Confirm gear is clean and repacked properly.
4. Notify the project manager or crew lead that equipment is ready for loading.


Quality Control
===============

- No equipment should be loaded without passing basic functionality tests.
- Every fixture, speaker, and panel must power on and operate correctly.
- Cables must be tested and coiled to standard.
- Each case must be fully inspected before closing.
- Failed items must be documented and removed from service immediately.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Fixture won't power on**  
- Check cables, connectors, and switch positions.  
- Try alternate power and DMX sources.

**Audio hum or noise**  
- Test with alternate XLR.  
- Verify grounding.

**LED tile fails test**  
- Swap power/data cables.  
- Replace the tile.

**Missing show files or configs**  
- Contact the project manager or lead technician.

**Large multi-day preps**  
- Spread across multiple zones; assign departmental leads.

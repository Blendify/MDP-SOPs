Staging Workflow
****************

The Staging workflow covers the process of organizing all pulled and scanned equipment into a
coherent, job-ready layout that supports fast, efficient truck loading and ensures every required
item is present and operational. Proper staging is critical for maintaining show quality,
minimizing load-out delays, and preventing forgotten or misplaced gear.

Staging is performed after **Pull Sheet** and **Scanning** steps are complete, and before **Truck
Loading** begins.


Purpose
=======

- Create a clean, organized setup of all outgoing equipment.
- Ensure all gear is grouped logically for the job’s workflow and loading order.
- Prepare equipment for on-site deployment with minimal rework or searching.
- Verify readiness through visual and functional inspection.
- Provide the crew lead or driver with a clear, complete picture of the outgoing package.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Lay out all gear in a clear, logical arrangement.
   - Group equipment by department and pack order.
   - Ensure cases are closed, latched, and labeled.
   - Maintain a safe walkable zone around the staging area.

Project Managers
   - Provide pack notes, diagrams, or specialty requirements.
   - Final-check staged equipment before loading.
   - Approve substitutions or changes discovered during staging.

Drivers & Crew Leads
   - Review the staged gear.
   - Identify missing or out-of-place equipment before loading begins.
   - Plan the pack based on the staging layout.


Required Tools
==============

- Staging carts / pallets
- Road cases and lids
- Safety straps, case labels, and gaff tape
- Sharpies or printed labels
- PPE (gloves, steel-toe shoes)
- Lighting and power testing stations (as needed)
- Radios for communication


Procedure
=========

1. Prepare the Staging Zone
---------------------------

1. Clear the area of unrelated equipment.
2. Ensure adequate floor space for all outgoing gear.
3. Sweep or clean the floor if needed to prevent case contamination.
4. Set aside:
   - Department-specific carts  
   - Pallets  
   - Road cases or lids  
5. Make sure exits and truck paths remain unobstructed.


2. Organize by Department
-------------------------

Place items in clearly separated groups:

- **Lighting**
  - Movers, static fixtures, LED bars
  - Power cables, DMX, clamps, safeties
- **Audio**
  - Speakers, subs, amps
  - Consoles, snakes, RF gear
- **Video**
  - LED tiles, processors, cameras
  - SDI, HDMI, fiber, converters
- **Power / Distro**
  - Camlock, stringers, breakouts, mults
- **Rigging**
  - Truss, motors, hardware, spansets
  
Label each area using tape or signs if the job is large.


3. Sort by Case Type & Pack Order
---------------------------------

1. Road cases → placed closest to the dock doors or loading point.
2. Carts → placed behind cases.
3. Loose items → staged in grouped sections or placed into appropriate cases.
4. Heavy items → ensure clear rolling paths.
5. Tall cases → placed together to simplify truck pack.

If the project manager provides a pack order diagram, follow that first.


4. Verify Completeness
----------------------

1. Compare the staged layout to the original pull sheet.
2. Confirm each item is present and accounted for.
3. Re-check small accessories:
   - Clamps  
   - True1/PowerCON jumpers  
   - DMX cables  
   - IECs  
   - Spare lamps / batteries  
4. Ensure all cables are coiled correctly and in the appropriate trunks.
5. Tests may be required for fixtures or electronics—complete before staging sign-off.


5. Case & Item Preparation
--------------------------

1. Close and latch all cases.
2. Tighten straps and secure lids.
3. Apply clear case labels:
   - Job name  
   - Date  
   - Department  
4. Mark carts or pallets clearly and visibly.
5. Remove any old labels, tape, or identifiers from previous shows.
6. Ensure small tools or consumables are in designated pouches or trunks.


6. Final Staging Review
-----------------------

1. Project manager or crew lead reviews the staged gear.
2. Resolve missing items or discrepancies immediately.
3. Prepare a “ready for loading” zone near the dock door.
4. Move staged equipment into loading sequence as the truck arrives.


Quality Control
===============

- Staging must be clean, organized, and free of clutter.
- Aisles must be wide enough for carts to move safely.
- No case should leave the staging area unlatched or unlabeled.
- Pack order must be logical and matched to the show’s workflow.
- All accessories should be consolidated to avoid on-site searching.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Confusing or irregular equipment lists**  
- Ask the project manager for clarification before staging.

**Last-minute adds**  
- Must be properly scanned and integrated into staging before loading.

**Damaged or missing items**  
- Replace with approved substitutions only.

**Large multi-truck shows**  
- Stage gear in clearly marked zones for each truck.

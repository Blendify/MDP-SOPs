Reset & Maintenance
*******************

The Reset & Maintenance workflow restores all returned equipment to full operational readiness,
ensures long-term reliability, and updates inventory systems to reflect accurate equipment status.
This process bridges the gap between Returns/Check-In and the next job’s Pull Sheet workflow.

Proper reset and maintenance extend equipment lifespan, reduce on-site failures, and maintain MP and
RV’s professional quality standards.


Purpose
=======

- Fully reset equipment after each job so it is clean, tested, and stored properly.
- Perform ongoing maintenance to prevent failures and extend asset life.
- Ensure equipment is correctly labeled, updated, and configured for future use.
- Track and resolve repair issues through Flex and Current RMS.
- Keep the warehouse organized and job-ready at all times.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Perform resets (cleaning, coiling, relabeling, sorting) for all returned gear.
   - Run basic function tests and identify issues for repair.

Repair Technicians
   - Diagnose and fix equipment that failed testing.
   - Document repairs, parts used, and resolution notes.
   - Update firmware, software, and internal settings as required.

Project Managers
   - Review damage reports and approve replacements or rebuilds.
   - Update asset records when equipment is retired or repaired.

Inventory Managers
   - Maintain consistency in labeling, storage, and organizational systems.


Required Tools
==============

- Electrical test stations
- DMX testers, audio analyzers, video signal generators
- Basic hand tools (multimeter, screwdrivers, wrenches)
- Cleaning supplies (wipes, air duster, alcohol)
- Label printer and replacement labels
- PPE (gloves, eye protection)
- Flex and Current RMS repair logging tools


Procedure
=========

1. Resetting Equipment After Return
-----------------------------------

Resetting is the process of preparing equipment to go back on the shelf fully cleaned, organized,
and show-ready.

1. Clean all exterior surfaces (cases, fixtures, cables, connectors).
2. Remove old tape, labels, and job identifiers.
3. Recoil all cables to the proper technique and length orientation.
4. Replace missing velcro straps or cable ties.
5. Insert cables into the correct trunk or department bin.
6. Match lids and cases properly—avoid mismatching case pairs.
7. Check interior foam for damage or foreign objects.
8. Update case labels if worn or unreadable.

Reset is complete only when equipment is indistinguishable from factory-ready condition.


2. Maintenance Testing
----------------------

For items routed to testing:

1. Power on all fixtures and electronics.
2. Perform full function tests:
   - Movement, color, strobe, zoom (lighting)
   - Audio outputs, RF sync, preamps (audio)
   - LED tile health, signal integrity (video)
   - Breaker function, continuity (power)
3. Check cables:
   - True1 / PowerCON  
   - Edison  
   - DMX / XLR  
   - SDI / HDMI  
4. Test for common failures:
   - Bad solder joints  
   - Intermittent signal drops  
   - Loose connectors  
   - Noisy fans  
   - Failing drivers or LEDs  

If an item fails any test → route to repair.


3. Repair Intake
----------------

1. Move failed items to the **Repair Queue**.
2. Create a repair ticket in Flex or Current RMS:
   - Asset number  
   - Description of the problem  
   - Notes from testing  
3. Tag the physical item with:
   - “Do Not Use”  
   - Issue summary  
   - Date of intake  
4. Place items neatly in the Repair area, organized by department.


4. Repair Work (Techs Only)
---------------------------

1. Disassemble components as needed for diagnosis.
2. Replace parts (lamps, drivers, fans, connectors, PCBs).
3. Re-solder or repair cables.
4. Update fixture firmware or software versions.
5. Clean internal components:
   - Dust  
   - Fan filters  
   - Optical paths  
6. After repair, perform full functional testing again.
7. If the repair is successful:
   - Close repair ticket  
   - Scan item back into inventory  


5. Retirement or Write-Offs
---------------------------

If equipment is beyond repair:

1. Document the condition thoroughly.
2. PM reviews for replacement budget or cross-rental needs.
3. Remove asset from Flex or Current RMS.
4. Tag the equipment as “Retired.”
5. Store in Retired Equipment Area for disposal or salvage.


6. Return to Inventory
----------------------

Once cleaned, tested, and functional:

1. Scan equipment back into inventory.
2. Store items in their proper shelf or storage location.
3. Ensure:
   - Cables are in the correct trunks  
   - Cases are in the proper zones  
   - Fixtures are properly foam-fitted  
4. Update any labels that have worn off or become hard to read.
5. Confirm inventory counts match shelf contents.


Quality Control
===============

- All items on shelves must be show-ready at all times.
- No “mystery gear” should remain untagged or untested.
- Repair tags must be detailed, legible, and accurate.
- Reset equipment should look clean and professional.
- Cable trunks must be organized by length and type.
- Testing should simulate real show conditions whenever possible.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Item fails intermittently**  
- Repeat testing under load.  
- Inspect connectors and cables thoroughly.

**Missing parts**  
- Document and search returns area.  
- Order replacements or notify PM.

**Unassigned unlabeled gear**  
- Move to Asset Review Bin.  
- Inventory Manager determines ownership (MP or RV).

**High-value repairs**  
- PM must approve major repairs or part orders.

**Low-stock consumables**  
- Notify warehouse manager to replenish stock immediately.

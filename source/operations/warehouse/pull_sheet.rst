Pull Sheet Workflow
*******************

The Pull Sheet workflow defines the standardized process for converting a confirmed job in
Current RMS or Flex into a complete, accurate, and staged equipment package. This workflow ensures
that all gear leaves the warehouse correctly scanned, tested, and prepared for transport to the
venue.

The purpose of this SOP is to:

- Ensure all equipment is pulled accurately based on the job requirements.
- Maintain correct inventory movement for MP and RV assets.
- Provide a predictable, repeatable workflow for staging gear.
- Reduce missing items, incorrect substitutions, and loading delays.
- Improve communication between warehouse staff, project managers, and technicians.

This procedure applies to anyone responsible for prepping or staging equipment for outgoing jobs.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Pull equipment according to the pull sheet without unauthorized substitutions.
   - Scan and verify all gear using Flex or Current RMS.
   - Report low stock, missing items, or damaged gear immediately.
   - Stage equipment in an organized, show-ready layout.

Project Managers
   - Confirm the pull sheet is complete and accurate before prep begins.
   - Approve substitutions or alternates when necessary.
   - Provide additional notes, pack lists, and diagrams if the job requires special handling.

Drivers & Crew Leads
   - Review the staged gear before loading.
   - Confirm everything required for the job is present and accounted for.


Required Tools
==============

- Flex or Current RMS (depending on MP or RV job ownership).
- Handheld scanners or mobile scanning app.
- Updated pull sheet (printed or digital).
- Marking tape, sharpies, and labeling tools.
- Equipment carts and pallets.
- PPE as required (gloves, steel-toe shoes, etc.).


Procedure
=========

1. Retrieve Job Information
---------------------------

1. Open Flex or Current RMS and navigate to the confirmed job.
2. Verify the job dates, venue, client requirements, and equipment list.
3. Print or load the pull sheet digitally.
4. Clarify any special instructions or notes from the project manager.

2. Prepare Staging Area
-----------------------

1. Clear a staging zone for the job.
2. Place empty carts, pallets, or road cases as needed.
3. Ensure adequate space for scanning, testing, and organization.

3. Pull Equipment
-----------------

1. Begin pulling equipment exactly as listed on the pull sheet.
2. For each item:
   - Verify its barcode.
   - Check MP vs RV ownership (ensure correct company assets are assigned).
   - Inspect for visible damage or missing accessories.
3. Place items neatly in the staging area based on pack order.
4. If an item is missing:
   - Search backup locations.
   - Notify PM if substitution or cross-rent is needed.

4. Scan Outgoing Inventory
--------------------------

1. Use the appropriate inventory system:
   - **Flex** for RV-owned assets.
   - **Current RMS** for MP-owned assets.
2. Scan each item as it enters the staging zone.
3. Confirm that all items register correctly in the system.
4. Double-check packaged items (cables in trunks, toolkits, distro contents, etc.).

5. Quality Check
----------------

1. Review the full staged kit against the pull sheet.
2. Confirm all required accessories are present:
   - Clamps  
   - Safety cables  
   - Power cables  
   - IEC/True1 jumpers  
   - DMX runs  
   - Spare lamps, batteries, consumables  
3. Test equipment if required (fixtures, audio, distro).
4. Tag any items that fail testing and replace them immediately.

6. Final Pack Preparation
-------------------------

1. Arrange items into logical loading groups:
   - Video  
   - Lighting  
   - Audio  
   - Power  
   - Rigging  
   - Carts vs. loose cases  
2. Secure small or loose items using tape or case labels.
3. Label carts or pallets with the job name, date, and destination.
4. Notify the driver or crew lead that staging is complete.

7. Sign-Off
-----------

1. Warehouse staff signs off that the pull is complete.
2. Project manager or crew lead reviews staged equipment.
3. Resolve any discrepancies before loading begins.
4. Mark the job as "Ready for Load" in Flex or Current RMS.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

- **Missing gear:** Notify PM immediately. Do not substitute without approval.
- **Damaged items:** Remove from service; tag and report to Repair Tech.
- **Last-minute changes:** PM must update the pull sheet before additional items are pulled.
- **Large jobs:** Use additional staging zones and assign multiple staff to prep.

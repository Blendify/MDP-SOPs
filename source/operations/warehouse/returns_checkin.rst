Returns & Check-In
******************

The Returns & Check-In workflow ensures that all equipment returning from a job is correctly scanned,
sorted, cleaned, tested, and restored to inventory. Proper check-in prevents loss, identifies damaged
items quickly, and prepares the warehouse for the next round of jobs.

This process begins immediately after gear arrives back at the warehouse and ends once all items have
been scanned, inspected, and routed to the appropriate zones (cleaning, testing, repair, or stock).


Purpose
=======

- Confirm all equipment listed on the job was returned.
- Document and isolate damaged or missing items.
- Restore equipment to usable condition for the next job.
- Maintain accurate MP and RV inventory records.
- Prevent cross-job contamination, loss, or misplacement.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Unload, scan, sort, and inspect all returned equipment.
   - Route items to correct zones: cleaning, testing, repair, or direct-to-shelf.
   - Report discrepancies or missing items.

Drivers
   - Assist in unloading and identify gear left onsite if applicable.

Project Managers
   - Review missing or damaged gear reports.
   - Communicate with clients or crew regarding lost items.

Repair Technicians
   - Receive damaged items and perform diagnostics or repairs.
   - Document repair status and return items to inventory when complete.


Required Tools
==============

- Flex app (RV assets)
- Current RMS check-in (MP assets)
- Barcode scanners or handheld devices
- Cleaning supplies (air, wipes, brushes)
- Cable testers, DMX testers, audio testers
- PPE (gloves, steel-toe shoes)
- Pallets, carts, or designated return bins


Procedure
=========

1. Unload the Truck
-------------------

1. Back truck to dock or unload area safely.
2. Remove carts and heavy items first.
3. Place all returned gear in the **Return Zone**, not the staging area.
4. Keep departments grouped (audio, lighting, video, rigging, power) for easier processing.
5. Watch for:
   - Wet or muddy cases  
   - Damaged casters  
   - Tilted or unlatched cases  


2. Scan All Returned Items
--------------------------

1. Scan each item **into the job return workflow** in Flex or Current RMS.
2. Verify:
   - Correct asset number
   - Correct ownership prefix (MP vs RV)
3. If an item appears that was not scanned out on the job:
   - Set it aside in the “Unassigned Returns” bin for investigation.

**Case Contents Requirement**
-----------------------------

All returned containers and road cases must be opened, and *every internal item must be individually
scanned back into the system before the case is considered returned*.

This includes:
- Cable trunks  
- Workboxes and toolkits  
- FOH cases  
- Lighting accessory bins  
- Media/SDI/adapter cases  
- Audio mic and RF cases  
- Distro and power accessory cases  
- Any multipurpose container with internal items  

Procedure:
1. Open the case as soon as it arrives in the return zone.
2. Remove and scan every internal item into the system.
3. Verify the quantity, type, and condition of each accessory.
4. Once all contents are scanned in and confirmed:

   - Scan accessories into the parent container and return items to the correct compartments.
   - Close the case.
   - Seal the case

5. The sealed case may now proceed to cleaning, testing, or direct-to-shelf storage depending on type.

Cases must **never** be closed or shelved without:
- Full internal scanning  
- Visual confirmation of contents  
- Proper sealing  

3. Sort by Condition
--------------------

After scanning, sort gear into these categories:

**Clean / Functional:**  
- Cables, trunks, or gear that can go directly to shelving.

**Dirty / Needs Cleaning:**  
- Cables with dirt  
- Cases covered in debris  
- Lens-smudged fixtures  
- Any equipment requiring basic cleaning

**Needs Testing:**  
- Fixtures  
- Consoles  
- Video gear  
- Power distro

**Damaged / Needs Repair:**  
- Bent connectors  
- Broken clamps  
- Non-functional electronics  
- Crushed or dented cases

Label bins or carts clearly to avoid cross-mixing.


4. Cleaning
-----------

1. Wipe down cases and hardware.
2. Remove tape, labels, and adhesive residue.
3. Clean lenses and surfaces on fixtures.
4. Blow out dust from electronics using compressed air.
5. Recoil cables neatly into correct trunks.
6. Dispose of trash or consumables left inside cases.

*Equipment must be clean before being returned to stock.*


5. Testing
----------

1. Power on and fully test:
   - Lighting fixtures  
   - Audio consoles and RF gear  
   - LED tiles and processors  
   - Power distro  
2. Look for:
   - Faulty DMX/power ports  
   - Missing accessories  
   - Firmware errors  
   - Pixel failures  
3. Test all cables (audio, data, power) for continuity or signal.

Failed items must be routed to the repair queue immediately.


6. Repair & Reporting
---------------------

1. Tag damaged items:
   - “Do Not Use”  
   - “Needs Repair”  
   - “Missing Parts”  
2. Create repair tickets in Flex or Current RMS as needed.
3. Notify the project manager of significant or costly breakage.
4. Update the job’s **Damage/Missing Summary** for billing or reconciliation.


7. Return to Shelf
------------------

Once an item is cleaned, tested, and functional:

1. Move it to its designated shelf or case storage.
2. Confirm proper placement based on warehouse layout.
3. Ensure all cables are in their correct trunks.
4. Store cases in assigned zones.

Never return untested or dirty gear to the shelf.


Quality Control
===============

- All returned items must be scanned before being moved.
- Nothing should skip cleaning or testing steps.
- Cables must be coiled correctly and tested before storage.
- Damaged gear must be isolated immediately.
- Unfamiliar or unassigned items must be flagged for manager review.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Missing items**  
- Re-check truck and staging area.  
- Contact crew lead or venue.  
- PM reviews “Missing Items Report.”

**Gear returned but not scanned out**  
- Investigate pull sheet; correct ownership tracking if needed.

**Severely damaged items**  
- Do not attempt repair.  
- Photograph and escalate to PM.

**Consumables or small parts**  
- Replace depleted stock from consumable bins.

**Cross-job gear confusion**  
- Use Unassigned Returns cart until verified.

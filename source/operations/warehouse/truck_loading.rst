Truck Loading
*************

The Truck Loading workflow ensures that all prepared and staged equipment is packed safely,
efficiently, and in a logical order that supports fast load-in, easy on-site deployment, and
protection of valuable equipment during transport.

Proper truck loading is essential for operational safety, reducing damage, maintaining show
efficiency, and ensuring that crews can work effectively upon arrival at the venue.


Purpose
=======

- Load equipment in a safe, efficient, and repeatable manner.
- Organize truck packs to support the on-site workflow.
- Protect equipment from transport damage.
- Ensure all staged and scanned gear is included in the truck.
- Prevent forgotten or misplaced items through systematic checks.


Responsibilities
================

Warehouse Staff
   - Load equipment according to pack order standards.
   - Ensure that cases are placed securely and properly oriented.
   - Maintain safe working conditions at the dock.

Drivers
   - Oversee truck pack structure and safety.
   - Ensure compliance with DOT weight distribution and securement.
   - Perform final walk-through before departure.

Crew Leads / Project Managers
   - Provide pack preferences or diagrams if required.
   - Verify specialty or fragile items are loaded correctly.


Required Tools
==============

- Dock plates, ramps, or liftgates
- Load straps, ratchet straps, and load bars
- Moving blankets (as needed)
- Pallet jacks
- PPE (gloves, steel-toe shoes)
- Flashlights or dock lighting
- Truck pack diagram (if applicable)


Procedure
=========

1. Prepare the Truck
--------------------

1. Inspect the inside of the truck for:
   - Debris  
   - Liquid spills  
   - Loose straps or hardware  
2. Confirm that:
   - E-track straps are available and functional  
   - Load bars are accessible  
3. Check that the liftgate, ramp, or dock alignment is safe and secure.

If the truck appears unsafe or unclean, correct the issue before loading.


2. Review Pack Order
--------------------

1. Follow the job’s pack diagram, if provided.
2. If no diagram exists, the general hierarchy is:

   **First In:**
   - Motors, rigging hardware, truss  
   - Power distro and feeder  
   - Heavy cases (amps, LED processors)  

   **Middle:**
   - Lighting fixtures  
   - Audio consoles and stage boxes  
   - LED wall tiles  

   **Last In (First Out at Venue):**
   - Tools and workboxes  
   - Carts  
   - Cable trunks  
   - Consumables and front-of-house gear  

3. Communicate the plan clearly to the load crew.


3. Load Heavy Items First
-------------------------

1. Start with truss, motors, and distro.
2. Place heavy cases on the floor against the bulkhead.
3. Avoid stacking heavy cases on lighter ones.
4. Ensure wheels are locked where applicable.


4. Load Medium Items
--------------------

1. Stack cases of similar size together to maximize stability.
2. Keep aisles clear for movement.
3. Ensure cable trunks, fixture cases, and video cases are tightly packed with minimal empty space.
4. Use blankets or padding between cases only when absolutely necessary.


5. Load Carts and Loose Items
-----------------------------

1. Load cart-based gear last so it exits first at the venue.
2. Secure carts using e-track straps.
3. Place loose items (e.g., sandbags, small tools) inside cases or trunks whenever possible.
4. Never load loose items unstrapped in the truck—they must be contained or secured.


6. Securing the Load
--------------------

1. Use ratchet straps or load bars to secure each segment.
2. Ensure that no items can shift during transport.
3. Perform a shake test: gently push cases to confirm stability.
4. Re-secure any loose items before closing the truck.

Drivers must approve final securement.


7. Final Checks
---------------

1. Walk the warehouse floor and staging area:
   - Confirm no gear was left behind.  
   - Check staging notes and pull sheet one last time.  
2. Verify:
   - Cases are latched  
   - Cables are coiled  
   - No gear is mismarked for another job  
3. Close the truck and lock if required.
4. Declare the job **Loaded** in Flex or Current RMS.

Drivers must complete a final inspection before leaving.


Quality Control
===============

- Every item in the staging area must be loaded unless marked otherwise.
- Carts and trunks should fit snugly and not move.
- Pack order must support fast load-in at the venue.
- No case should be loaded sideways, upside-down, or unlatched.
- Loose items must be secured inside cases or strapped.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Truck is too small for the job**  
- Notify the project manager immediately.  
- Prioritize critical gear and prepare a second run or truck.

**Last-minute add-ons**  
- Must be scanned, staged, and repacked in correct order.

**Odd-shaped items**  
- Load in corners or strap individually to prevent shifting.

**Multiple trucks**  
- Use clearly labeled sections: Truck 1, Truck 2, etc.  
- Stage separate zones for each truck before loading.

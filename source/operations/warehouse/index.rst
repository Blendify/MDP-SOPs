Warehouse Operations
********************

The warehouse is the central hub of Maryland Productions and Event Revolution, supporting all
incoming and outgoing equipment, job preparation, logistics coordination, and post-event
processing. This section documents the standardized procedures required to maintain consistent,
accurate, and safe warehouse operations.

The purpose of the Warehouse Operations SOP collection is to ensure:

- Accurate asset tracking between MP and RV inventory.
- Efficient and error-free job prep, staging, loading, and returns.
- Safe handling of equipment, power distribution, and rigging materials.
- Clean, organized, and predictable warehouse conditions.
- Clear communication between warehouse staff, logistics, project managers, and technicians.
- Consistent quality control across all production types and scales.

All members of the warehouse, logistics, and technical teams should review and follow these
procedures.

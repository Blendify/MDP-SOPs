Advancing / Pre-Production
**************************

The Advancing SOP defines how Maryland Productions and Event Revolution gather, confirm, and document
all technical, logistical, and scheduling details required to successfully execute a show. Advancing
begins once a job is **contracted and confirmed**, and ends when the show is fully ready for
warehouse prep, crew scheduling, and on-site deployment.

A well-advanced show prevents confusion, reduces last-minute changes, and ensures every department
(Lighting, Audio, Video, Rigging, Power, Warehouse, Logistics) has the information needed to deliver
a consistent, high-quality event.


Purpose
=======

- Collect all critical event details from the client and venue.
- Translate client needs into technical and logistical plans.
- Ensure each department receives accurate information before prep.
- Reduce errors, delays, and onsite troubleshooting.
- Provide the warehouse, drivers, and crew with clear instructions.
- Keep the client informed and confident throughout planning.


Who Handles Advancing
=====================

- Project Managers (primary)
- Technical Directors (for complex shows)
- Crew Leads (as assigned)
- AVisionary (supports communication and info gathering)

All advancement must be documented in the job file and shared with departments.

On-Site Protocol
****************

The On-Site Protocol SOP defines the expectations, standards, and professional behaviors required of
all Maryland Productions and Event Revolution staff while working at a venue. This includes load-in,
show operation, client interaction, backstage etiquette, and strike.

Every MP/RV technician, freelancer, and crew lead represents the company on-site. Consistency in
professionalism, safety, and communication is essential for maintaining strong client relationships
and ensuring successful events.


Purpose

- Ensure safe, efficient setups and strikes.

- Minimize risk, damage, and delays during production.

=======================

- Technicians (Lighting, Audio, Video, Rigging, Power)
- Crew Leads / Department Heads
- Drivers
- Warehouse Assistants supporting load-in

Sales & Client Experience
*************************

The Sales & Client Experience chapter defines the workflows, communication standards, and
relationship practices used by Maryland Productions and Event Revolution to ensure a consistent,

handling, quoting, contracting, client communication, expectation management, on-site experience,
and post-event follow-up.

This chapter outlines how MP/RV presents itself to clients—from the first inquiry to the final
invoice—and ensures everyone follows the same standards of clarity, accuracy, and professionalism.

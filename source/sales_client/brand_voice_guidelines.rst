Brand Voice Guidelines
**********************

The Brand Voice Guidelines define how Maryland Productions (MP) and Event Revolution (RV) present
themselves through written and verbal communication. A consistent brand voice reinforces
professionalism, builds client trust, and ensures that every message—whether from sales, project
managers, technicians, or AVisionary—reflects the same level of polish and reliability.

These guidelines apply to **all client-facing communication**, including emails, texts, calls,
proposals, documents, on-site interactions, and social media messages.


Purpose
=======

- Establish a unified communication style across all MP/RV staff.
- Strengthen brand identity and client perception.
- Ensure professionalism in all written and verbal communication.
- Provide guidance for responding to leads, clients, vendors, and venue staff.
- Reduce tone inconsistencies that can confuse or frustrate clients.


Core Brand Voice Characteristics
================================

MP/RV’s voice should consistently feel:

**Professional**  
Clear, organized, and confident. No jargon unless appropriate.

**Friendly**  
Warm and approachable without being overly casual.

**Solution-Oriented**  
Focus on solving problems, not emphasizing obstacles.

**Calm & Composed**  
Even in stressful situations, communication should remain steady and respectful.

**Clear & Direct**  
Say what you mean without rambling or ambiguity.

**Client-Focused**  
Emphasize the client’s goals and concerns, not internal challenges.


Tone: What to Do and What to Avoid
==================================

Do:
- Use plain, professional English.
- Engage with a helpful attitude.
- Acknowledge client concerns.
- Provide clear steps or options.
- Keep messages concise and structured.
- Confirm important decisions or changes in writing.

Avoid:
- Excessive technical jargon (unless speaking to a technical client).
- Sarcasm or negativity.
- Overly casual language (“lol”, “gotcha”, “my bad”).
- Sounding rushed, annoyed, or uncertain.
- Overpromising solutions before checking internally.
- Criticizing clients, venues, vendors, or crew.


Examples of Brand Voice in Practice
===================================

Email Greeting Examples
-----------------------

Good:
- "Hi Sarah, thanks for reaching out."
- "Good morning James, happy to help with your event details."

Avoid:
- "Yo man!"
- "Heyyyy :)"


Tone in Updates
---------------

Good:
- "Here’s an update on where we are with your lighting plot..."
- "We’re confirming the rigging schedule with the venue and will share details shortly."

Avoid:
- "Idk what’s happening yet, waiting on the venue."
- "We’re slammed right now, I’ll get to it later."


Explaining Issues
-----------------

Good:
- "We identified an issue with one of the fixtures. We have a replacement on the way and this will not affect your schedule."

Avoid:
- "One of your lights broke. Not our fault."


Offering Solutions
------------------

Good:
- "We have two options for addressing this:..."
- "Here’s a workaround that will keep everything on schedule."

Avoid:
- "Well that’s just how it is."


Client Boundaries
-----------------

Good:
- "Let me check with the team and get back to you."
- "That option would require additional labor; I can send an updated estimate."

Avoid:
- "Sure, we can do anything you want!" (Overpromising)
- "We don’t do that." (Solve or redirect)


Writing Style Standards
=======================

Format:
- Short paragraphs  
- Bullet points when helpful  
- Descriptive subject lines  
- Use bold for emphasis sparingly  
- Keep emails readable on mobile devices  

Grammar:
- Use proper punctuation  
- Avoid run-on sentences  
- Use straight quotes (per MP style preference)  

Clarity:

- Provide call-to-action when needed  


Professional Phrasing Templates
===============================

**Acknowledging a request:**  
- "Thanks for your message—here’s what I can share so far."

**Managing expectations:**  
- "This change may affect the timeline; here are the options."

**Requesting clarification:**

**Providing next steps:**  
- "I’ll follow up with an updated quote by tomorrow afternoon."

**Closing an email:**  
- "Please let me know if you need anything else."  
- "Happy to help with any additional questions."


Internal vs. External Tone
==========================

**Internal (Slack, email between staff):**  
- More direct, more technical  
- Still professional, still documented  
- Avoid complaining about clients or staff

**External (clients, vendors, venue staff):**  
- Structured, clear, positive  
- Always assume messages may be forwarded or shared

Quality Control

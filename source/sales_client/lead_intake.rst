Lead Intake
***********

The Lead Intake SOP defines how Maryland Productions and Event Revolution capture, qualify, and
organize new inquiries. This is the first step of the client journey and sets the foundation for
accurate quoting, efficient communication, and successful project execution.

A consistent intake process ensures that all essential details are collected early, improving
turnaround times and minimizing back-and-forth during the quoting phase. Lead Intake is typically
performed by the **AVisionary**, sales staff, or project managers handling incoming requests.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure every lead is captured with complete and accurate information.
- Standardize what details must be collected before quoting begins.
- Reduce delays caused by incomplete or unclear client requests.
- Screen for date, venue, and budget conflicts early.
- Improve communication between sales, project managers, and operations.


Who Handles Lead Intake
=======================

- AVisionary (primary)
- Sales team members
- Project Managers (if the lead comes directly to them)
- Administrative staff assigned to monitor incoming requests

All leads must be entered into the appropriate system, even if handled by a PM.


Required Information (Minimum Criteria)
=======================================

Every lead must include:

1. **Client Name & Contact Information**
   - Company (if applicable)
   - Phone number
   - Email address

2. **Event Date(s)**
   - Load-in date  
   - Event/show date  
   - Strike date  

3. **Venue / Location**
   - Full venue name
   - Address or at least the city
   - Known restrictions (if client mentions them)

4. **Service Type**
   - Full production  
   - Rental only  
   - Lighting / Audio / Video / Power / Rigging  
   - Hybrid or specialty service  

5. **Rough Budget Range**
   *Required for MP quoting accuracy.*

6. **Event Description**
   - Type of event (wedding, concert, conference, gala, etc.)
   - Expected audience size
   - Technical expectations (if known)

Without these details, the lead is considered **incomplete**.


Optional / Helpful Information
==============================

- Load-in constraints (dock, elevator, access)
- Client timeline or schedule
- Designer or TD contact info
- Previous events with MP/RV
- Notes on aesthetics or creative direction
- Multi-day or multi-room requirements
- Known power availability or rigging points


Lead Intake Sources
===================

Leads may come from:

- Email inquiries  
- Phone calls  
- Website form submissions  
- Social media messages  
- Returning clients  
- Venue referrals  
- Walk-ins  
- Rental requests from other production companies  

Regardless of source, all leads follow the same intake checklist.


Procedure
=========

1. Capture the Inquiry
----------------------

1. Respond to the client within **1 business day** whenever possible.
2. Gather required details (minimum criteria list).
3. Ask clarifying questions if needed, such as:
   - “Do you have a preferred load-in time?”  
   - “Is there a venue contact we should coordinate with?”  
   - “Do you have a rough budget in mind for this event?”  
4. Document the conversation in writing (email follow-up).


2. Enter the Lead Into the System
---------------------------------

1. Create a new lead in:
   - Current RMS (MP)  
   - Flex (RV)  

   *Use the job type that matches the primary asset ownership.*

2. Add:
   - Client information  
   - Event dates  
   - Notes from the initial inquiry  
   - Budget range  
   - Service type  
3. Tag the lead appropriately (venue name, event type, etc.).
4. Assign a project manager or sales lead if known.


3. Qualification Check
----------------------

Before sending the lead to quoting:

1. Confirm date availability (crew, equipment, and vehicles).
2. Ensure the client’s budget aligns with their expectations.
3. Flag any potential conflicts (multiple jobs, limited inventory).
4. Determine whether the lead is worth pursuing:
   - **Qualified** → Move to Quoting  
   - **Not a Fit** → Decline politely and thank the client  
   - **Needs More Info** → Request missing details  


4. Initial Client Response
--------------------------

Send a warm, professional response:

- Thank the client for reaching out.
- Briefly restate the project details for confirmation.
- Request missing information (if needed).
- Provide next steps (usually quoting timeline).

A template response may be included in a future SOP.


5. Internal Handoff
-------------------

1. Once qualified, assign the job to a project manager.
2. Update the lead status to:
   - *Qualified*  
   - *In Estimating*  
3. Notify the PM via:
   - Email  
   - Slack  
   - Direct message  

4. PM begins the **Quotation** stage.


Quality Control
===============

- All required information must be collected before building a quote.
- Leads must be entered into the system *before* any proposal is created.
- Response times should be consistent and prompt.
- Notes must be clear, detailed, and written professionally.
- Leads should never be lost due to poor documentation.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Client will not provide a budget**  
- Explain that MP/RV can tailor solutions to their range and it helps with accurate quoting.

**Venue unknown**  
- Ask for the city and type of space.  
- Flag that the quote may change after venue details are confirmed.

**Rush inquiries (same day or next day)**  
- Notify PM immediately.  
- Mark as *Urgent* in the system.

**Low-quality lead or unrelated inquiry**  
- Decline politely or refer elsewhere.

**Client requests unsupported services**  
- Be transparent and recommend alternatives if appropriate.

Client Communication Standards
******************************

The Client Communication Standards SOP defines how Maryland Productions and Event Revolution staff
communicate with clients at every stage of the job lifecycle. Consistent, clear, and professional
communication builds trust, reduces misunderstandings, and creates a strong foundation for long-term
relationships.

This SOP applies to **all** staff who communicate with clients—sales, project managers,
technicians, warehouse, logistics, and freelancers representing the company on-site.


Purpose
=======

- Ensure all communication with clients is professional, consistent, and timely.
- Set expectations for tone, clarity, responsiveness, and documentation.
- Reduce confusion during quoting, advancing, and on-site operations.
- Strengthen MP/RV’s brand identity and client relationships.
- Provide staff with clear examples of correct communication practices.


Core Principles
===============

All client-facing communication must follow these principles:

**1. Clarity**  
Speak plainly, avoid jargon unless the client is technical, and confirm important details in writing.

**2. Professionalism**  
Maintain a polite, respectful tone—especially under pressure.

**3. Timeliness**  
Respond quickly to questions, changes, and issues.

**4. Consistency**  
Ensure all staff represent the company with a unified voice and style.

Record important decisions, approvals, and changes in the job notes.


Communication Channels

- Email (preferred for documentation)
- Phone or video calls

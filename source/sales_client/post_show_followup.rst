Post-Show Follow-Up
*******************

The Post-Show Follow-Up SOP outlines the procedures for concluding client interactions after an
event has ended. This includes confirming that the client was satisfied, addressing any outstanding
questions, communicating billing details, and maintaining a positive long-term relationship.

A consistent follow-up process helps reinforce professionalism, increases repeat business, and
ensures that no loose ends remain after the show is complete.


Purpose
=======

- Provide clients with a smooth, professional closing experience.
- Gather feedback and identify opportunities for improvement.
- Confirm any additional labor, add-ons, or damages that affect billing.
- Strengthen long-term client relationships.
- Ensure all relevant departments receive post-show notes.


Who Handles Post-Show Follow-Up
===============================

- Project Managers (primary)
- Sales Staff (for recurring clients)
- AVisionary (support role)
- Administrative staff (billing and invoice questions)

Technicians or crew leads may provide information to the PM but should not directly handle billing.


Timeline
========

The follow-up process begins **on the first business day after the event** and continues until the
job is fully closed out.


Procedure
=========

1. Internal Debrief
-------------------

Before contacting the client:

1. Review:
   - Crew notes  
   - Warehouse return notes  
   - Missing/damaged item reports  
   - Labor hours logged  
   - On-site changes or issues  
2. Identify anything that:
   - Affected the schedule  
   - Impacted equipment usage  
   - Requires additional billing  
   - Needs improvement for next time  

3. Update notes in Current RMS or Flex for full documentation.


2. Client Thank-You Message
---------------------------

Send a professional follow-up email thanking the client.

The message should include:
- Appreciation for working with MP/RV  
- Confirmation that the event was successful  
- Invitation to share feedback  
- A brief reminder that billing documents will follow (if applicable)

Tone should be:
- Warm  
- Concise

3. Billing Preparation
----------------------

Work with accounting or the designated billing role to prepare the final invoice.

Include:
- Base contract amount  
- Additional labor hours if triggered  
- On-site add-ons requested by client

Before sending the invoice:

- Proofread descriptions and totals  


4. Send Final Invoice
---------------------

Once prepared:

1. Email the invoice to the client.
2. Provide a brief summary of the charges.
3. Offer to answer any questions.
4. Clarify payment deadline and acceptable methods.
5. Record invoice sent date in the job file.


5. Handle Client Questions or Concerns
--------------------------------------

If the client asks about charges or disagreements:

- Respond promptly and clearly.
- Reference contract terms when necessary.
- Explain labor, truck, or add-on charges using neutral, factual language.
- Escalate unusual disputes to management if needed.
- Remain calm and professional even if client is frustrated.


6. Gather Client Feedback
-------------------------

Encourage feedback when appropriate:

- Ask about what worked well.
- Ask if there were any challenges.
- Document notes for future reference.

Feedback helps improve operations, quoting accuracy, and technical delivery.


7. Update Client Profile

Record important client preferences in the system:

- AV preferences  
- Crew requests  
- Load-in behavior  
- Budget patterns

These notes help future interactions run smoothly.

A job is ready for closeout when:

- All equipment is returned or accounted for  
- All damages are logged  
- All labor is entered  
- Invoice is sent and recorded  
- Feedback is collected  
- Documentation is archived  

Then:

- Change job status to **Closed** in the system  
- Archive files in the shared drive or documentation folder  


Quality Control
===============

- Follow-up must occur within one business day when possible.
- All client communication should be professional and clear.
- Invoice accuracy must be double-checked.
- Post-show notes should be detailed, not vague.
- Client preferences must be documented for future shows.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Client does not respond**  
- Send a second email in 3–5 days.  
- Attempt a polite phone call if necessary.

**Client disputes charges**

- Adjust invoice only with management approval.

**Client had a poor experience**  
- Listen empathetically.  
- Apologize if appropriate.  
- Offer solutions or improvements.  
- Escalate serious issues to management.

**Large multi-day or recurring clients**  
- A scheduled post-mortem meeting may be appropriate.

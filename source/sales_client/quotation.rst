Quotation & Proposal
********************

The Quotation & Proposal SOP defines the standardized process for building accurate, professional,
and profitable estimates for Maryland Productions and Event Revolution. This stage begins once a
lead has been qualified and sufficient information has been gathered (venue, date, service type, and
rough budget).

Clear, consistent quoting ensures that clients understand exactly what they are receiving, reduces
miscommunication, and provides reliable information to project managers, warehouse staff, and
technicians.


Purpose
=======

- Produce accurate and consistent quotes across MP/RV.
- Ensure pricing reflects true equipment, labor, trucking, and consumable costs.
- Set clear expectations for clients before advancing begins.
- Provide project managers with the correct information for planning.
- Maintain profitability by avoiding underestimation and scope creep.


Who Handles Quoting
===================

- Project Managers (primary)  
- Sales Staff  
- AVisionary (for smaller rental quotes)  
- Senior Technicians (specialty systems as needed)

All quotes must be created in the correct system based on **asset ownership**:

- **MP-owned gear → Current RMS**  
- **RV-owned gear → Flex**  


Required Information Before Quoting
===================================

Before building a quote, the PM must have:

- Client name and contact  
- Event date(s)  
- Venue (full name at minimum)  
- Rough budget range  
- Type of event  
- Service type (rental vs full production)  
- Scope of work (lighting, audio, video, rigging, power)  
- Any known constraints (dock, setup time, ceiling height, outdoor event, etc.)

If any of these are missing, return the lead to **Lead Intake** for clarification.


Quotation Procedure
===================

1. Create or Open the Job
-------------------------

1. Open Current RMS (MP) or Flex (RV).
2. Create a new job or convert an existing lead.
3. Enter:
   - Client name  
   - Event name  
   - Venue  
   - Dates  
   - Notes from intake  
4. Tag the job appropriately (venue, event type, department).


2. Build the Equipment List
---------------------------

1. Add all required equipment based on:
   - Client needs  
   - Past shows or templates  
   - Internal recommendations  
2. Use correct asset models and quantities.
3. Include:
   - Accessories (clamps, safeties, adapters)
   - Cables (power, data, audio/video)
   - Infrastructure items (pipe, truss, motors)
   - Backup gear for mission-critical roles
4. Verify availability (stock levels, existing bookings).

**Never assume equipment is available without checking.**


3. Add Labor
------------

Labor must be included for all full production jobs.

Common labor line items:
- Load-in crew  
- Operators (lighting/audio/video)  
- Labor supervisors / crew leads  
- Spotlight operators  
- Truck drivers  
- Riggers  
- Stagehands  
- Overnight labor if applicable  

Confirm labor hours using:
- Venue access information  
- Event schedule  
- Local labor rules if applicable  


4. Add Trucking / Transportation
--------------------------------

Include:
- Box truck rental  
- Cargo van usage  
- Driver labor  
- Mileage or flat-rate charges  
- Additional trips if multi-day or heavy setups  

Transportation is often underquoted—err on the side of accuracy.


5. Add Consumables / Miscellaneous
----------------------------------

Examples:
- Tape  
- Batteries  
- Zip ties  
- Safety consumables  
- Soft goods cleaning fees  
- Media cards (if applicable)  

Small items add up—include them to avoid absorbing costs.


6. Add Notes / Assumptions
--------------------------

In a clean, professional writing style, include:

- What the quote includes  
- What the quote does *not* include  
- Client responsibilities (power, rigging approval, permits, etc.)  
- Special instructions or limitations  

This prevents major misunderstandings later.


7. Internal Review
------------------

Before sending:

1. Double-check pricing for errors.
2. Confirm totals align with the client’s stated budget range.
3. Re-read description and notes for spelling and clarity.
4. Ensure no equipment is double-listed or missing.
5. Confirm the correct company (MP or RV) is used.

Large or complex quotes may require a second reviewer.


8. Send the Quote
-----------------

When sending the proposal:

- Use a polite, professional tone.
- Summarize the offer in the email body.
- Attach PDFs or send via system-generated client link.
- Offer to answer questions or revise as needed.
- Record the sent date in the job.

Quotes should be sent within **1–3 business days** of intake whenever possible.


9. Follow-Up
------------

If you have not heard back:

- **Day 3–5:** Send a friendly reminder.  
- **Day 7–10:** Follow up again or close the lead if unresponsive.  
- **Always log follow-ups** in the job notes.

Do not pressure the client—be helpful, not pushy.


Approved Quotes
===============

Once the client accepts:

1. Change job status to **Approved** or **Confirmed**.
2. Notify warehouse and logistics of upcoming dates.
3. Move the job into the **Contracting** stage.
4. Confirm inventory lock-in.
5. Start advancing.


Quality Control
===============

- Quotes must reflect real inventory and availability.
- Notes must be clear, unambiguous, and grammatical.
- Quotes should appear professional and consistent across all PMs.
- Avoid underpricing—consult historical shows if unsure.
- Keep a record of client revisions and requests.


Troubleshooting & Exceptions
============================

**Client requests a lower price**  
- Offer alternate configurations or reduced labor if possible.

**Budget is unclear**  
- Return to intake and request a range before quoting.

**Venue not known**  
- Provide a *range-based* estimate with a note stating that final pricing requires venue confirmation.

**Specialty equipment not in inventory**  
- Include subrentals and mark clearly in the quote.

**Extremely fast turnaround**  
- Prioritize essential items only and flag the estimate as *rush*.
